“My mom @annamaria7gen went back to training six days after having my sister Maria, then made weight and won the judo US Open six weeks later [and] when she was pregnant with me, she only gained 12 pounds. I’ve decided to let her keep those records,” the professional wrestler, 34, captioned a Tuesday, October 5, mirror selfie."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Since breaking both my hands and getting pregnant it feels like I lost a lifetime of muscle — it’s easy to get discouraged over all that lost progress — but if anything, I’m looking forward to getting cleared to train again even more. This is an opportunity start over and mold my body into its next phase. #BaddestMomOnThePlanet.”</p><p>The athlete hilariously concluded by noting that she cropped out the ice pack in her underwear.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ronda-Rousey-Shows-Postpartum-Body-1-Week-After-Birth-Im-Recovering-Faster-Than-Planned-002.jpg><p>Rousey’s husband, <strong>Travis Browne</strong>, gushed about the retired mixed martial artist in the comments, writing, “Six weeks can’t get here soon enough!! Damnit you’re sexy!!”</p><p>The couple <a href=#>wed in 2017</a> and announced four years later that they were <a href=#>starting a family</a>. Their baby girl arrived last month.</p><p>“La’akea Makalapuaokalanipō Browne,” the new mom wrote via Instagram in September, while the mixed martial artist, 39, added, “Welcome to this world. You are so incredibly loved!”</p><p>On Sunday, October 3, the actress reflected on her first moments with the little one, writing via Instagram: “I can’t believe Pō is over a week old already. She’s so perfect I wish we could bottle up these times and revisit them forever.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Brie Bella</strong></a> commented, “I always think about the first hours with my babies!!! I’d do anything to go back to those moments!!! Love seeing you as a Mama.”</p><p>Rousey’s WWE contract may have expired in April, but the company’s President & Chief Revenue Officer <strong>Nick Khan</strong> assured the My Fight Your Fight author’s fans at the time that she would be “coming back … in the not too distant future.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGarp56Zrm6%2Bzq6qnrFdqLWww9JmaGavlZq4brzOrKupmaKpwq55waibsmWZonqzscKorZ6qmaO0cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
