We want to get it done and out,” the<a href=#>&nbsp;<i>Mighty Ducks&nbsp;</i></a>actor joked during the panel. “<a href=#><i>Fast Furious</i></a>-style [with multiple movies]!”</p><p class=p1>Thompson and Mitchell, also 44, both appeared on&nbsp;<i><a href=#>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a>&nbsp;</i>on Friday, March 17, where they revealed<a href=#> when they are currently planning to begin production</a> on “part 2” of&nbsp;<i>Good Burger</i>.</p><p class=p1>“It’s unbelievable, it’s a blessing,” Thompson gushed during the surprise late-night interview. “We’re gonna shoot it this summer and it will be out soon.”</p><p class=p1><i>Good Burger&nbsp;</i>— which premiered in 1997 —&nbsp;took inspiration from Thompson and Mitchell’s&nbsp;<i>Kenan & Kel&nbsp;</i>sketch of the same name, a spinoff of&nbsp;<i>All That</i>. Despite a cult following for the flick, the twosome<a href=#> long played coy about the possibility of a sequel</a>.</p><p class=p1>“We were [just] at the table read and everything,” Mitchell<a href=#> exclusively teased to&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in December 2022</a> while attending the <a href=#>People’s Choice Awards</a>. “It’s going down [but] they don’t want us to say too much right now.”</p><p class=p1>Now that&nbsp;<i>Good Burger 2&nbsp;</i>has officially been greenlit by Nickelodeon and Paramount+, Thompson and Mitchell couldn’t help but spill filming secrets at 90s Con. The&nbsp;<i>Heavyweights&nbsp;</i>actor revealed that production was slated to start this summer before a potential Thanksgiving release.</p><p class=p1>Thompson also joked about<a href=#> the potential of special cameos</a> from Denberg, 47, Tamberelli, 41, and other famous faces. “I keep saying <a href=#><strong>Harry Styles</strong></a>,” he joked on Saturday. “<a href=#><strong>Sinbad</strong></a> is definitely going to be back even<a href=#> if we have to go to him</a>. [Former president] <a href=#><strong>Barack Obama</strong></a> would be great.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>All That&nbsp;</i>90s Con panel was also slated to include fellow cast member <a href=#><strong>Amanda Bynes</strong></a> — who also <a href=#>landed her own&nbsp;<i>Amanda Show&nbsp;</i>spinoff</a> after her&nbsp;<i>All That</i>&nbsp;tenure — however, she dropped out early on Friday. At the end of Saturday’s event, Mitchell <a href=#>gave the 36-year-old&nbsp;<i>She’s the Man&nbsp;</i>star a sweet shout-out</a> and asked the crowd to “send a prayer” to Bynes to “feel better.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>What a Girl Wants&nbsp;</i>actress did not previously reveal why she would be absent from <a href=#>the convention</a>.
