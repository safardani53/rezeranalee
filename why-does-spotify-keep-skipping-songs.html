This problem is a glitch on Spotify's side, and it seems to be one that occurs between 30 and 45 seconds into a song. Understandably, many users are deeply annoyed by the issue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Is Spotify down?

As Spotify works to correct the issue on their end, here are things you can try on your end to resolve the problem.</p><p>The first step is to try logging out of and back into the app, which is hopefully a fairly painless experience for most people.</p><p>If logging out doesn't work, you can try deleting and reinstalling the app to see if that resolves the issue. You can also disconnect from the internet and then reconnect, or try restarting your device completely to see if either of those has an effect.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>If neither of those steps do anything, try checking your app store to see if Spotify needs any updating, or clear your cache in Spotify by opening the app and navigating to Settings, then Storage, and then selecting "Delete Cache."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Spotify has faced backlash for non-technical reasons.</h2><p>Although this technical issue may be a bigger problem for many users than political controversy, Spotify has been in the news in the past thanks to a backlash around podcaster <a href=#>Joe Rogan</a>, who signed an incredibly lucrative deal with the company to produce his podcast exclusively for their platform. Spotify refused to break its deal with the popular podcaster but has also promised to pledge money to developing podcasts from other voices.</p><p>In the end, most users use Spotify because it's a convenient way to stream music and podcasts. If the app becomes glitchy or difficult to use, that is likely to be a bigger issue than any controversy around a podcaster. Joe Rogan may be flat-out wrong about the some things, but he's also a major selling point for Spotify's brand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxlo6W8tbXFsmSknZWlerS3yKmnoqaXYsCwusas</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
