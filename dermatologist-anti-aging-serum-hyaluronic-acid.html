Priced at $68, the serum was so effective it even took the dermatologist by surprise.</p><p>"This serum blew me away," Dr Vee said. "The anti-aging effects came within just one week of daily use whereas no other serum worked faster."</p><p>It's so effective that she doesn't just recommend it to clients: this is Dr Vee's serum of choice for personal use, too.</p><p>You can apply this serum and then go about your day thanks to the unique formula that allows super-fast absorption.</p><p>What if you're not just worried about wrinkles, but battling other signs of aging, too, like discoloration and severely dry patches?</p><p>If that describes your skin, Dr Vee recommends using the super-powerful <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">SkinCeuticals Hyaluronic Acid Intensifier, $106</a>.</p><p>"This hardworking serum is pricey," she admitted, "but is highly effective at restoring parched skin."</p><p>Plus, the ingredients aim to battle a full list of skin concerns. Licorice root and purple rice, for example, reduce common skin issues like hyperpigmentation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000751177416.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000751177380.jpg><p>Finally, if you have "sandpaper-dry" skin that's resisted other treatments, Dr Vee said the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">SkinMedica HA5 Hydrating Complex</a> is your best bet for serious anti-aging results.</p><p>"This satisfyingly rich serum could be a serious game-changer for you," she said. At $111, the serum is the highest-priced recommendation on Dr Vee's list, but with good reason.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>The formula is enriched with not one, but five different types of hyaluronic acid. Those complexes work together with peptides to help speed up collagen production, Dr Vee explained.</p><p>"It leaves the skin looking plump and smooth immediately," she explained, "while also working to stave off fine lines in the long run."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5Bya2loaWmGcLDEq6SarJ%2BhvKi10q1kmqaknnqis8innmarlafCrnnHspilraKku6qvjJqaopxf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
