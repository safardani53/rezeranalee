How can I solve each one?</h2><p>The main types are:</p><h3>Anagrams</h3><p>Anagrams have three parts, a definition, an anagram indicator and the anagram fodder (which are the letters to be shuffled).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nintchdbpict000337798528.jpg><p>These puzzles are indicated by a hint word such as “muddled”, “strange”, “wild” or “drunk” – so look out for these words.</p><p>There is a list of indicator words to learn <a href=# rel=noopener>here.</a></p><p>For example, in the cryptic crossword “Do legal owners free birds? (4-5,4)”, “free” would be the indicator word alerting you to the fact it is an anagram puzzle.</p><p>The indicator word comes next to the phrase that is anagram fodder and needs its letters reshuffling.</p><p>In this case, “Do legal owners” is the anagram fodder, “birds” is the definition hint, so the answer is “Long-eared owls”.</p><h3>Charades</h3><p>Another type is Charades, which is when a word or phrase is broke up into separate parts, as in a game of Charades.</p><p>Separate parts are defined one after another.</p><p>For example, in the cryptic crossword “Weapon used by many a Round Table knight (8)”, the answer would be “Lancelot”.</p><p>This would be made from the “weapon” being a lance, and the Round Table knight would make this Lancelot.</p><h3>Containers and Contents</h3><p>Containers and Contents are similar to Charades as they contain words or phrases that can be broken up into separate parts one after the other.</p><p>However, with this new category, you have to wrap the outer word around the inner word (Container) or you have to put the inner word within the outer word (Content).</p><p>You can tell if it is Container or Content using the cryptic indicator hint word.</p><p>If the word is inside or around the cryptic indicator (Container), look out for indicator words such as “holding”, “surrounding,” or “swallowing.”</p><p>If the inner word needs to go within the outer word (Content), look for indicator words such as “within”, “filling”, or “entering”.</p><p>For example, in the cryptic crossword “Relative entering Highland dance and showing off (9)” you know the inner word needs to go within the outer word due to “entering”.</p><p>Your next step is to look at “relative” and “Highland dance and showing off” to get the final answer of “flaunting”, containing “aunt” for “relative” and “flaunting” for “showing off”.</p><h3>Deletions</h3><p>Deletions are words and phrases in a cryptic clue indicating that letters are to be removed.</p><p>There is a full list of them <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>, and can either mean removing the first letter, last letter, or a central letters, depending on which is used.</p><p>For example, in the cryptic crossword “Beheaded celebrity is sailor (3)”, the word “beheaded” mean that a word loses its first letter.</p><p>You then look at the other words to reach the answer “tar”, as celebrity is also known as a “star” and you “behead” the first letter.</p><h3>Double definitions</h3><p>These are the simplest kind of cryptic crossword as you get two hints at the answer.</p><p>For example, in the cryptic crossword “Yearn for quite a while (4)” the answer would be “long”, as it fits with both parts of the phrase.</p><h3>Hidden words</h3><p>For hidden words, the solution can be embedded within the clue or concealed inside a longer word.</p><p>Typically “hidden” indicator words are used, such as “buried in”, “concealed” or even “in” and “from”.</p><p>For example, in the cryptic crossword “Pole coming from Pakistan or Thailand (5)” you can tell it is a hidden word, due to “from” being in the phrase.</p><p>Then you scan the letters for a word fitting the phrase, and the answer is “north”, found hidden between Pakista<strong>n or Th</strong>ailand.</p><h3>Homophones</h3><p>Homophones are pairs of words or phrases that have indicators referring to sound, like “so we hear” or “it’s said” or “speech”.</p><p>The answer will be something that is similar in pronunciation, but spelt slightly differently.</p><p>For example, in the cryptic crossword “Narrow channel – not winding, we hear (6)”, the answer would be “strait”.</p><p>From “not winding” you’d deduce “straight”, and different spelling of this is “strait”.</p><h3>Reversals</h3><p>As the name suggests, reversals refer to words or phrases that can be reversed to give new words.</p><p>An indicator word like “turned”,&nbsp;“backward” or “reversed” made be used as a hint.</p><p>For example, in the cryptic crossword “Physician brings fish round (3)”, the answer would be “doc”.</p><p>This would be because “fish round” would be “cod” with the letters reversed round the other way.</p><h3>Cryptic definitions</h3><p>With cryptic definitions, these consist of just a definition and are phrased to be deliberately confusing.</p><p>They typically rely on word play and are considered hard as there is no indicator or hint to help.</p><p>For example, in the cryptic crossword “A heavenly lighter (3)”, this would be the sun.</p><h3>&lit</h3><p>This refers to crosswords that are a contraction of “and literally so”.</p><p>These puzzles have an indicator word, and then the whole phrase is used for the solution.</p><p>For example, in the cryptic crossword “Terribly evil (4)”, the word “terribly” would be an indicator, and then you can work out the answer of “vile” by unscrambling the cryptic fodder.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
