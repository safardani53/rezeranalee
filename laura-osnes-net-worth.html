Indeed, reports have emerged that Laura was fired from a Hampton's stage production after admitting that she did not receive either vaccine jab and doesn't plan to do so because she does not trust the science behind it.</p><p>Broadway productions fall under the recent New York City mandates that require attendees and performers to be vaccinated.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, Laura's co-star, Tony Yazbeck, pressed her to reconsider getting the vaccine because "he has two little kids at home" that he wants to protect.

She has spoken about her values and beliefs in the past.</h2><p>According to that same report from Page Six, it appears that Laura has previously identified herself as a "Christian conservative," although no further clarification on her political stance beyond that was given.</p><p>There are also rumors that a since-deleted video circulating on social media of a rally held in former president Donald Trump's honor showed Laura in attendance, but these claims haven't been verified.</p><p>Despite the questions emerging about her political stance and the lack of confirmation from Laura on the matter, it appears that she is cordial with both Democrats and Republicans.
