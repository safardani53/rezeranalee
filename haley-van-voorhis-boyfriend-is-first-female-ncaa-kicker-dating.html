As the wide receiver and defensive back, Voorhis was 2019 All-State Honorable Mention in Virginia.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, Voorhis played for the D.C. Divas as the strong safety in the Pro division of the Women’s Football Alliance in Washington D.C., where she recorded 21 tackles in 5 games.&nbsp;</p><p>On September 23, 2023, Voorhis made a new record when she played in the Hornets’ game against Juniata Eagles, becoming the first woman to play in a position other than kicker.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, at just 5-foot-6 and 145 pounds, she was able to register a quarterback hurry.</p><h2>Haley Van Voorhis Boyfriend: Who Is The Hornets Star Dating?</h2><p>Haley Van Voorhis doesn’t seem to have a boyfriend at the moment.</p><p>Besides having no official announcement of her dating anyone, the Hornets star hasn’t posted any pictures on her social media that might suggest that she is dating someone.&nbsp;</p><p>However, that is not to say that she is not dating anyone.

However, with no information about her personal life available, perhaps it is best to just celebrate the rising star’s record-breaking achievement.</p><h2>Road To Creating History</h2><p>Heidi, Haley’s mother, remembers all too well when her daughter, as a toddler, asked her why there weren’t any girls on the field.</p><p>That question made her speechless, however, it paved the way for Haley to become an athlete.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Haley-Van-Voorhis-With-Her-Mother-Source-NY-Post.webp><p>Voorhis was never the one to be discouraged by the lack of girls playing football. Instead, it came to her as a surprise and made her want to be the one playing football.</p><p>Her father, Chandler, remembers going to watch football games with the family when his daughter would tell the family that she would be in the field someday.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, Voorhis’ parents claim that their daughter has always been determined and hard-working.</p><p>She was the first girl to play football at her high school as well. When the boys in her team started getting big, Voorhis would sweat out in the gym to get even stronger.&nbsp;</p><p>In a recent interview, she suggested younger girls who look up to her to expect the journey to be extremely hard, physically and mentally.&nbsp;</p><p>The 20-year-old has moved on from this record-breaking feat and is now focused on her next challenge. She is focused on getting opportunities to play more and be a better football player.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC0wKWcsmWmlrtuws6oqaGho2KvsMXFq6CeppRitrR5xaKprKxdm7KurcueZKebkZZ6rLXCpJyrZZSWwaq6xmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
