I can’t believe it.”</p><p>That same day, the Million Dollar Baby actress took to social media to celebrate <a href=#>the major milestone</a>. “Coming soon … DOUBLE feature! 👼🏼👼🏼,” she captioned an Instagram video of her rubbing her stomach.</p><p>The Oscar winner and Schneider began dating in 2016 after being set up by mutual friends and <a href=#>secretly exchanged vows</a> two years later.</p><p>“I was overwhelmed with such gratitude and thanks to be <a href=#>marrying the man of my dreams</a> and to see all the people we love together in the middle of such a profound setting. It was truly a dream come true,” Swank told <a href=# rel=noopener>Vogue</a> in 2018. “It was timeless. There is just no other way to describe it.”</p><p>The Boys Don’t Cry star’s love for her husband has only grown amid her pregnancy.</p><p>“Philip is <a href=#>spoiling her rotten and being really sweet</a> and devoted the whole time,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly in October 2022, adding that Swank “feels like she hit the jackpot with Philip” as “their connection is so soulful and special.”</p><p>However, not every aspect of the Hilaroo Foundation founder’s journey to motherhood has been smooth sailing.</p><p>“I was <a href=#>having some bouts of morning sickness</a> for a while there,” she told Extra TV in October 2022. “My friends tell me when you have double, it doubles the hormones, double the sickness, double the everything.”</p><p>The expectant mother also joked about <a href=#>trying to keep her pregnancy a secret</a> while filming Alaska Daily.</p><p>“I was cutting my pants open in the back because they weren’t fitting me anymore … and people were like, ‘That doesn’t really match’ and I’m like, ‘Well, I think her shirt could be out here,’” she explained.</p><p>Swank previously stated during a 2010 interview with InStyle that she was waiting until “the time is right” to have children. After sharing the news about her twins, <a href=#>an Instagram user criticized her</a>, writing, “AREN’T YOU LIKE 50 YRS OLD” on the social media announcement. The Fatale actress’ former costar <a href=#><strong>Emmy Rossum</strong> </a>— who appeared with her in the 2014 film You’re Not You — came to her defense.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“GFY,” Rossum, 36, replied to the hater, employing a common acronym for “go f—k yourself.”</p><p>Scroll down for a closer look at Swank’s Golden Globes style:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BcvK2wxKdkoKSfl7K0eZFpaWxloKeyqLrAp6tmoJmhrrPFjKyumqabYsSiuMqsZKudlGKwor7Pnqto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
