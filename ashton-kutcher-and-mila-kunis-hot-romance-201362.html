He did a movie that was very similar: No Strings Attached,” the actress recalled on the “WTF” podcast in July 2018. “We lived our movies out, where we were like, ‘Let’s just hook up. Let’s have fun. We’re both single. We both trust each other. Everything’s great.’ None of us wanted tension. OK, great. We hooked up for three months. And just like our movies, one of us caught feelings.”</p><p>Kunis got jealous when Kutcher revealed he was dating someone else. After admitting her realization to him, he asked her to move in with him.</p><p>She later pointed out that they forged ahead despite public perception and events from previous relationships. “We went into this relationship super transparent with one another, so we knew 100 percent each other’s faults, we knew exactly who we were,” she explained on the “Armchair Expert” podcast in July 2018. “And we were like, ‘I accept you for who you are.’”</p><p>The Bad Moms star noted in August 2018 that their onscreen collaborations were likely in the past. “Probably not going to happen,” she confessed on Sunday TODAY With Willie Geist. “I can’t look at him and not be like, ‘What are you doing?’ It’s like a weird — no, no, it’s weird.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The pair <a href=#>don’t deprive their supporters of cute moments</a>, though. “Oh, Mila Kunis, I love you,” Kutcher declared during a September 2019 episode of Hot Ones. “If I don’t make it out of this, honey, take care of the children.”</p><p>Scroll down to revisit highlights from Kunis and Kutcher’s relationship:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkrrS006ilZqOlqbCpsdFmmKecXaK2ra2MpKynoaNitbDAjKumppmemLJufo9qam9qXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
