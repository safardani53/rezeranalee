That never was the impact at all. That was true love at the time.</p><p>“But once you get on the show and things are starting to be insinuated — from the conversations about ‘beards’ to me being controlling — it becomes a whirlwind of things.”</p><p>Two weeks ago, Stewart penned an article for The Players Tribune in which he insited he was not gay.</p><p>The successful signal-caller made it clear that he has “nothing but love for everybody, no matter what their sexual orientation is,” and added he was happy to see how the “world has evolved” since the rumors about him went viral..</p><p>“It’s sad to say, but at that time, it was a death sentence,” Kordell recalled of how his reputation suffered for many years.</p><p>“It never happened. It was a lie. But that wasn’t the point, right?” Stewart also said of the aforementioned arrest.</p><p>Does Stewart have any regrets about appearing on The Real Housewives of Atlanta?</p><p>“No, because in marriages there’s two words — there’s compromise and sacrifice, right?” he told Hall.</p><p>“And sometimes when giving up yourself to your mate, you end up making decisions sometimes that can either make or break you.</p><p>“To be honest with you, if I had to do it again I probably would not do it, but I’m not ashamed of doing it. Because I was really doing it for her because it was her opportunity to be on this stage in which she’s on right now and I’m happy for her.</p><p>“At the end of the day, it’s really not about that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Stewart played a total of 125 NFL games over the course of his career.</p><p>He finished with a 55.8% completion percentage, 77 touchdown passes and 84 interceptions.</p><p>Overall, Kordell led 14 game-winning drives during this time.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2V%2FcLfOq5uepJxiwLWx1pqprWWZonqvu9NmnpqxXaO8tXnToZitZaSdsrOx0maYp7Gknbavs4ywqaiml2LEqsDHZqto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
