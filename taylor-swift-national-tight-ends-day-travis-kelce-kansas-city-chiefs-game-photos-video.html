The unofficial holiday is meant to celebrate the tight end position in football, which is considered to be one of the most underrated positions in the sport, according to some. Since Travis is considered to be one of the best tight ends in NFL history, it’s only fitting that he play a game in front of his fans and Taylor on the special day.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Before her latest appearance at a Chiefs game, Taylor attended several other games to support Travis. Her first was back in September, when she broke the internet with her surprise attendance. She then <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>attended another game</a> in New Jersey with some of her celebrity friends, including <strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong>, <strong>Blake Lively</strong>, and <strong>Sophie Turner</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-national-tight-ends-day-travis-kelce-kansas-city-chiefs-game-embed.-jpg.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Taylor and Travis have also been seen on various outings over the past few weeks, including a dinner outing and a Saturday Night Live afterparty. The duo made cameos in an episode of the show earlier this month and were also seen holding hands during their dates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5xe5FrZq2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2jrrW1zqeYpWWknrSpwIyepZ2rXZmuunnTq5ivoaNiuKa4wp5kpJmeqK60ecKiq7Jlk522prLSZp6apZVivam706iqZq6ZmbKwew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
