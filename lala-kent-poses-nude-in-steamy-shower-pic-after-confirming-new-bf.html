Several of her fellow Bravolebrities cheered her on in the comments, including costar <strong><a href=#>Kristen Doute</a>,</strong> who gushed, “That’s my girl 🔥👏.”</p><p><a href=#>Real Housewives of New York City</a>‘s <a href=#><strong>Leah McSweeney</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Sonja Morgan</strong></a> left heart and fire emojis, while <a href=#>Real Housewives of New Jersey</a> star <a href=#><strong>Margaret Josephs</strong></a> wrote that the photo was “Stunning Perfection 🔥🍑💕💋👧🏼.”</p><p>Kent’s NSFW post comes <a href=#>two weeks after she revealed that she is in a new relationship</a> following her messy split from<a href=#><strong> Randall Emmett</strong></a> in November 2021. “I think I might be in love with someone,” the Give Them Lala founder said during an October 7 appearance on SiriusXM’s Jeff Lewis Live. “<a href=#>My friend’s been trying to hook me up with him</a> for a long time and we finally met. We’ve hung out like, literally, that was the third time. We had a lot of fun.”</p><p>She continued: “I love his brain. He’s very smart. His face doesn’t match what comes out of his mouth. He’s a unicorn. … <a href=#>I’m gonna need to have his baby or something</a>.”</p><p>One week later, Kent shared another major perk of her new romance at BravoCon 2022. “<a href=#>I’m having the best sex of my life</a>, which I mean, compared to my old relationship that was not hard to do,” the reality TV personality exclusively told Us Weekly. “Oh, this shade! I can’t stop. I haven’t conquered the art of being quiet.”</p><p>While she’s “having a lot of fun” with her mystery beau, Kent explained that she doesn’t plan on <a href=#>sharing it with the world on the next season of Vanderpump Rules</a>. “You won’t see me, like, dating, but you’ll see the dude who I hooked up. <a href=#>[He was] the first boy I slept with since my last relationship</a>,” she teased about what season 10 will bring. “Which was very weird. I was like, ‘There’s cameras here.’ And I’m like, ‘This is a boy that I’m gonna hook up with. This is weird.'”</p><p>The Utah native and the Emmett, 51 — who <a href=#>share 18-month-old daughter Ocean</a> — called off their engagement last year amid <a href=#>allegations of the producer’s infidelity</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I feel like it’s weird because I, <a href=#>for the first time, have no idea what my future holds</a>,” Kent confessed during a November 2021 episode of her “Give Them Lala” podcast. “I don’t know what each day is going to look like and for a really long time, I’ve had a schedule where everything is planned out. My future was ahead of me and I was like, ‘This is the plan.’ And I’m kind of just letting the universe take control of my life and place me where I need to be. I’m not questioning anything.”</p><p>Emmett, for his part told the “Genuinely GG” podcast in March, “<a href=#>I am never going to comment on any of [the cheating accusations]</a>. I just feel like what I am going through and what I have gone through — my mistakes and my accountability. She also has a side to it which I will never go into but we have Ocean,” the Midnight in the Switchgrass director said at thee time. “<a href=#>I just can’t talk badly about the mother of my child</a>. I just can’t do it. No matter what is said about me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGalmZyWeqyxza1kqaejmsBuutSdnGahnmLAtbHAprBmq5ikxKa%2BjKmgnGWRm8Gmvoycpqeemae6qrrGZqWer12Xs3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
