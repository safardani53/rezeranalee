The actress, 49, took to social media on August 29 to share a series of pics while in remission in her ongoing battle with multiple sclerosis, also known as MS. “A week of health and healing in a golden place,” she captioned the photo set, which began with a snap of her rocking a floor length purple robe, while clutching onto a mug in one hand, and using her cane in the other.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The&nbsp;Legally Blonde&nbsp;star was also seen biting into an apple while stunning in a one-shouldered black swimsuit in the wooded paradise. The post came a few weeks after Selma revealed her MS experience would be <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>documented in a new, intimate new film</a> from director <strong>Rachel Fleit</strong>, titled Introducing, Selma Blair.&nbsp;It will arrive in theaters and on Discovery+ on October 21, three years after she first revealed she had been&nbsp;diagnosed with the autoimmune disease.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I was told to make plans for dying. Not because I have MS, because I’m fighting MS,” Selma said in the trailer. She later added, “I’ve been given a second chance at life. I promised myself I wouldn’t judge the process, and I’m judging the process. Everything beautiful that I’ve known, that I’ve encouraged other people — will it be true for me too?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Selma-Blair-swimsuit-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>In an October 2018 Instagram post, Selma broke the news that <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she had been diagnosed with the disease</a>&nbsp;in August of that year. The actress detailed some of the effects in the caption. “I am disabled. I fall sometimes. I drop things. My memory is foggy. And my left side is asking for directions from a broken gps,” she wrote. “But we are doing it. And I laugh and I don’t know exactly what I will do precisely but I will do my best.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Earlier this month, fellow actress <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Christina Applegate</strong></a> announced that she had also <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>been diagnosed with the disease</a>. “It’s been a strange journey. But I have been so supported by people that I know who also have this condition,” she wrote on August 9. “It’s been a tough road. But as we all know, the road keeps going. Unless some asshole blocks it.” <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Selma responded with support</a>: “Loving you always. Always here. As are our kids. Beating us up with love.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5FyZqydnKKubq7LmqCrZZ%2Bjsm68yJ6anmWjrLauv9Siq2aomKTBsL%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
