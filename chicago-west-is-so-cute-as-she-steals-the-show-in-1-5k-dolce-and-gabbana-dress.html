Her mom Kim dressed her five-year-old daughter in the designer dress for an event with her cousins.</p><p>She wore the pink silk gown with black lace-up boots, with little baby pink bunny hairbands in a half-up half-down hairdo. Chi even matched some little stud earrings and a necklace with her stylish outfit.</p><p>Chicago’s Dolce & Gabbana chiffon silk dress set her mom back $1,445, while her Dr. Martens 1460 boots added an extra $80 to the total cost. The event she dressed up for was a throwback to an Easter-themed family meet-up!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Khloé Kardashian (@khloekardashian)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chi-steals-the-show-so-cute>Chi steals the show: ‘So cute’</h2><p>When Chicago smiled in her dress for Auntie Khloe, fans cooed over just how “cute” she looked. One fan <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a> in the comments of a fan page post of the pic: “Such a beautiful dress 😍 and my favorite color too.”</p><p>Another noticed how similar Chicago and Dream look. “Aww Chi and Dream actually look quite similar 😍😍,” they said. Other words like “the cutest” and “Chicago is so cute here!!” filled the comments section.</p><p>Chicago’s dress only heightened her petite frame. “Chicago is so petite and Dream is gorgeous!

Their cousin True, five, also wore a pink dress matched with bunny ears and sneakers.</p><p>Dream, <a href=#>Rob Kardashian</a>, and <a href=#>Blac Chyna</a>‘s six-year-old daughter wore a fluffy light pink dress with sneakers. She also went for the half-up hair-down look while she smiled at the camera.</p><p>However, Chicago West’s dress kinda stole the show, and it makes total sense as her Met Gala queen mom Kim is usually reigning in attention for her outfits.
