In March 2016, after 19 years together, the couple got engaged <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>on-air during Howard Stern’s SiriusXM radio show</a>. And on Sunday night, they <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>tied the knot right in the middle of Times Square</a> on live TV as part of Fox’s New Year’s Eve with Steve Harvey special!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While finding her groom was easy, tracking down the perfect dress for a New Year’s Eve wedding was a challenge for Menounos. Being that the ceremony was held outside in freezing New York City, the TV and Sirius XM radio host knew she had to find a dress that not only looked good on camera, but also protected her from the elements.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“You have to think you’re outside in Times Square, it’s freezing, you need something beautiful but appropriate,” Menounos tells PEOPLE exclusively.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So she started the dress search where every bride does — on Pinterest. “I quickly went onto Pinterest and started looking at wedding gowns. I’ve never really been that girl that’s done that,” she explains. “I never really envisioned that day.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for MM</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for MM</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In her search, she found a Pronovias gown and immediately knew she needed to try it on. But once she got to the showroom and finally put on her dream gown, she discovered there might be a few hiccups.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I had to think production-wise, I may have one or two minutes to get into this thing, I’m getting dressed in a storage container in Times Square in the freezing cold, and I can’t have something that had a little lining underneath. If you didn’t do it just right, your underwear lines [could get] messed up or you’re going to see them. I was like, ‘This is not the dress.'”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For more exclusive details on Maria Menounos’ wedding, pick up the next issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Jan. 12</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Luckily, there was an option even better sitting in the showroom. And once she tried on a second dress, she knew it was the one immediately. “The cameraman who doesn’t even know me, cried,” she shares. “It was such a moment, I cried too.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for MM</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Menounos ended up choosing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Pronovias’</a> strapless lace <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>“Randala” design</a>, with a mermaid silhouette, sweetheart neckline and mesh detail on the bodice to add “just a touch” of sexy. The gown also comes with a matching lace detachable coat featuring a dramatic train (perfect for the freezing temperatures in Times Square!).</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for MM</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It took my breath away,” she says. “When I started crying, I was like, ‘This is clearly the dress.'”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED PHOTOS: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Best Celebrity Wedding Dresses of 2017</a></strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Embracing tradition, Menounos didn’t want Undergaro, who opted to wear a Ralph Lauren tux, to see her dress until their wedding day especially because it’s such a switch-up from her usual style. “It’s so not me to be so girly and princess-y or maybe it was me and it was just so repressed,” she says. “That’s probably the truth.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Maria Menounos Reveals She Was Diagnosed with a Brain Tumor—While Her Mom Is Fighting Stage IV Brain Cancer</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The wedding starts a fresh new year for Menounos who faced a challenging 2017. After caring for her mother who has stage 4 brain cancer, she discovered that she had a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>golf-ball-size meningioma brain tumor</a> herself. She later had a successful surgery that removed 99.9 percent of the tumor, which was benign.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now looking back, she says the experience she went through was “a gift,” she told PEOPLE last summer. “I saw it as a huge blessing because I needed to change my life.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Menounos continued: “As women, we’re always thinking you have to be the perfect daughter, the perfect friend, worker, everything, it’s exhausting,” she said. “We’re caretakers and we put ourselves last. Always. I guess I realized I didn’t value myself in a lot of ways. That was a really important lesson for me.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So far, 2018 is already turning out to be a very exciting next chapter in that journey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6Opxq2xjqaYq6GRYrqmus6upairXayypbDIp55mnKKawLR5w56rmqGcqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
