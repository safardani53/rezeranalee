When my kid was born, I was so nervous, I didn’t know what I felt,” Adam told&nbsp;Access Hollywood&nbsp;in June 2006. “Five minutes later, maybe 10 minutes later, it was me and the kid and a nurse. We walked down alone to just check the vital signs and all that stuff, and I had a chemical reaction in my body, where I loved the kid so much, and I was so nervous for her, and that’s when I lost my mind for the kid.”</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Over the years, the twosome have worked together on several projects, from 50 First Dates to Grown Ups. Adam has spent the majority of his decades-long career, however, opposite some of Hollywood’s biggest leading ladies – including <a href=#><strong>Drew Barrymore</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a>.
