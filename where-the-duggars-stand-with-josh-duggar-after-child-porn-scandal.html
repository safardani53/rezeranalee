Josh Duggar’s ups and downs have tested his family over the years — and caused many of them to publicly denounce him and his actions.
The eldest child of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar made headlines in 2015 after multiple girls claimed he had molested them years prior. Josh apologized for his actions at the time, revealing that he’d previously sought counseling for his “wrongdoings” as a teen."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Josh <a href=#>apologized for his actions</a> at the time, revealing that he’d previously sought counseling for his “wrongdoings” as a teen.</p><p>“Twelve years ago, as a young teenager, I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret,” Josh wrote via the family’s Facebook account in May 2015. “I hurt others, including my family and close friends.”</p><p>The incident — <a href=#>which involved four of Josh’s sisters</a> — and <a href=#>its resurfaced story</a> led to the Duggars reexamining their dynamic. In April 2021, <a href=#><strong>Jinger Duggar</strong></a> exclusively <a href=#>told Us Weekly</a> that despite the pain that Josh brought to the group, everyone came out stronger.</p><p>“Our family was way closer because of that, <a href=#>and in spite of that</a>, I guess you’d say. I will never forget how I felt in that moment,” Jinger said at the time. “And I think even everything that happens in our lives — because we’re in the public eye — it makes it more challenging because then it’s not just dealing with these things inwardly, but you have to give an answer to the world. That makes it a much tougher thing to walk through.”</p><p>Later that month, Josh again turned heads when he was <a href=#>arrested in Arkansas</a> for allegedly receiving and possessing child pornography. His family was put through the wringer once more, with <a href=#>multiple siblings speaking out about the case</a>.</p><p>“The recent accusations brought against Josh sadden us to our core. We have not wanted to be hasty in making any statements while trying to process the news ourselves,” <a href=#><strong>Joy-Anna Duggar</strong></a> and her husband, <strong>Austin Forsyth</strong>, said in a statement via their Instagram Stories in May 2021. “We are especially heartbroken by the reality that there are children in the world being harmed and exploited. <a href=#>We ask for prayer for all those involved</a> and it is our continued prayer that the truth comes to light.”</p><p>In December 2021, Josh was convicted of <a href=#>two counts of receiving and possessing child pornography</a>. He was sentenced in May 2022 to 151 months, <a href=#>which equates to a little over 12 years</a>, in prison for his crimes.</p><p>“This trial has felt more like a funeral than anything else,” sister <a href=#><strong>Jill Duggar</strong></a> said <a href=#>in a statement</a> on her and husband <a href=#><strong>Derick Dillard</strong></a>’s blog following <a href=#>the conclusion of the trial</a>.</p><p>Josh’s mom, however, continued to fight for her son to be released. In a letter obtained by the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> in May 2022, Michelle requested leniency when it came to Josh’s sentencing, arguing that he is a good man deep down.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[Josh] has friends and family who will love and support him in his abilities to succeed as a husband, father, business owner, and man both now and in the future,” she wrote, noting that she still offers her “continued love and encouragement to Joshua.” Michelle added: “We ask that he would be reunited with his wife and family in a timely manner.”</p><p>Scroll down to see where <a href=#>Josh stands with the rest of the Duggar family</a>:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkxKmx0Z5kraCVYrG2s8aaqaxlo6mur7CMsKCtoF2fvLS0jJ2soJ%2BRp3qistOeqWabmJ65pXnPqKmnZaOYrq%2BwwKVm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
