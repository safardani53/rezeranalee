Clayton Echard addressed the events that transpired at the after-party in the previous episode in Episode 5.&nbsp;Ankney interrupted the celebration of the winners of a football game and hurled the trophy into the pond. Echard was astonished when the women told him of the occurrence, so he contacted Ankney to hear her side of the tale.</p><p>She said the truth, but she added that she wanted to apologize to the girls. Ankney made a teary-eyed apology, which she subsequently admitted on video was a forgery. She likened her acting to Meryl Streep’s and said that she is deserving of the Oscar, Emmy, and Golden Globe Awards.</p><h2>Viewers criticize Shanae Ankney for her phony apologies</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Shanae-Ankney-3.jpg alt="Shanae Ankney" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Echard would ask Ankney to leave, the suitresses were certain. Echard, on the other hand, was observed applauding Ankney for mounting the stand following her apology-drama.&nbsp;The plot surprise occurred when he selected Ankney over Sierra Jackson, who had been warning Echard about Ankney from the start. In addition to the suitors, viewers may witness Ankney’s true side as well as her phony tears.&nbsp;Fans of the dating show are condemning Ankney for her crocodile tears apologies, and many are amazed that Echard couldn’t see her truth.</p><h2>Everything you need to know about The Bachelor Episode 5</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Shanae-Ankney-2.jpg alt="Shanae Ankney" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Shanae was not present on The Bachelor Episode 5’s group date this time. Russell Peters, a comedian, attended the date and urged the suitors to ridicule Echard and each other. Finally, a group date went off without a hitch.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Genevieve Parisi and Ankney were ready for their 2-on-1 match at the hotel. Echard goes on a date with both of them but only returns with one suitress. The stakes are high for Parisi, who is well aware of Ankney’s strategy.</p><p>The rose ceremony on The Bachelor Episode 5 rescued Marlena Wesh, Teddi Wright, Eliza Isichei, Susie Evans, and Serene Russell. Shanae Ankney, Genevieve Parisi, Hunter Haag, Mara Agrait, Rachel Recchia, Gabby Windey, and Sarah Hamrick are among the cast members.</p><p>“It always backfires,” Sierra Jackson says of her decision to send Shanae Ankney home. ‘The Bachelor’ fans Sierra Jackson, Lyndsey Windham, and Jill Chin all departed the program after failing to win a rose from Echard. Every Monday at 8 p.m. Eastern Time, the show’s network Bravo airs new episodes of Season 26.
