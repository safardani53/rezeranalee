In an interview with Charlamagne Tha God, he stated:</p><p>‘I’ve had a number of chats with folks about leaving.’</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pete-Davidson-2.jpg alt="Pete Davidson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It’s difficult because you don’t want to fire the trigger too soon. Everyone has always said, ‘You’ll know when you know, and everything will be OK.’</p><h2>More information about Pete Davidson</h2><p>In 2020, he released The King of Staten Island, a biopic based on his life, establishing himself as a real breakthrough star, following in the footsteps of Kristen Wiig.&nbsp;Pete likened Kim Kardashian’s ex-husband Kanye West to Mrs Doubtfire in his new Netflix comedy special earlier this month, making fun of his girlfriend’s custody fight with her ex-husband.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Pete-Davidson-3.jpg alt="Pete Davidson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to Pete Davidson:</p><p>‘Does anybody else secretly wish Kanye pulls a Mrs. Doubtfire?’</p><p>When I got home one day, they said, “This is the new housekeeper.” “What’s up, fam?” he says. The joke alludes to the 1993 family comedy in which Robin Williams portrays a freshly divorced dad who disguises himself as a female cleaner in order to spend more time with his children. Kim was there for the taping, which took place on April 30 at the Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles.&nbsp;With films like the semi-autobiographical The King of Staten Island, Davidson has used his enormous notoriety as an SNL cast member to further his career.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGinnqyVYrGiwsidqqimXZ7Abr%2FErWStp12ZsrGt0a1kn6qfonq0rdOuqZ2ZqWK7qrPHrWSloaaaeqKy056pZqyYmnq0scCspqdllp67orjEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
