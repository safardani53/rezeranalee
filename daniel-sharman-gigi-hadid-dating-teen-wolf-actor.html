She told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Women’s Wear Daily</a>,&nbsp;“I love Cody to death and he loves me. And he needed his time to focus on his music and he’s the one who broke up with me,” she revealed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“We’re still best friends and I’ll always respect him and support his career. But it’s really hurtful when people try to do that.
