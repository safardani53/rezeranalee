His video was reshared by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@thepaulmccomas51</a>.</p><p>Colton really thought he did something spectacular when he announced that he works twice as many hours as most of us do in a week.</p><p>Paul captioned the recently resurfaced video: “If you work less than 100 hours a week, lower your tone when you talk to me.”</p><p>However, Colton's weird flex wasn't well-received by Paul or the internet at large.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>After his post went viral the first time around, the internet dug up some pretty <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">disturbing dirt</a> about Colton, but that’s a story to another day …</p><p>On another note, his video did spark a much-needed conversation about the downside of hustle culture.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Chasing the American dream shouldn’t feel like a nightmare, but thanks to capitalism, here we are. Many of us have to work two, or even three jobs to make ends meet, and with all the time we spend working to live, we slowly but surely find ourselves living to work … just ask <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@brian_is_inked</a>, who found this out the hard way.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Brian also worked in an oilfield, where he too put in hella overtime. He shared his cautionary tale in a November 2022 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on TikTok. “So I see a lot of people post across TikTok and social media like working over 100 hours a week is some kind of f------ flex or something; Like it’s a master achievement that’s been unlocked," he said.</p><p>He asserted that the man in the viral post was trying to make it seem like he’s “better than somebody that [doesn’t] work as much” as him.</p><p>“When in reality, you’re the dumb and ignorant one — they’re the smart ones. They’re not the ones wasting their f------ life away working,” Brian went on.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Brian revealed that choosing work over his home life is a decision he regrets to this day. In the comment section, other users echoed his sentiments.</p><p>"In the transition for change now. [My] son is gonna be 8 ... I missed his baby years,” one user, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@snafuberta1.0</a> wrote.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@Elko775</a> added: “Well said! I thought it was a flex in my 20s and old timers would laugh at me and now I know the reasons.”</p><p>But for some users, the message went completely over their heads.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>“100 hours a week is impressive — that’s 14 hours, seven days a week. You lose a lot of memories but you’re building the best life possible for your family,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@calebhearn</a> commented.</p><p>It’s important to ask yourself: What good is putting in the hours if you can’t enjoy the fruits of your labor? Just some food for thought.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfZn1xeceorKtlp6S%2FrHnWnpyk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
