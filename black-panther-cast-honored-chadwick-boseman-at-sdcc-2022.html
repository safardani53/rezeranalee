We put our love for Chadwick into this film and we also put our passion.

From&nbsp;<i>Marshall&nbsp;</i>to&nbsp;<i>Da 5 Bloods</i>, August Wilson’s&nbsp;<i>Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom</i>&nbsp;and several more, all were filmed during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy. It was the honor of his career to bring King T’Challa to life in&nbsp;<i>Black Panther</i>. He died in his home, with his wife and family by his side.”</p><p class=p1>Amid filming of&nbsp;<i>Wakanda Forever,&nbsp;</i>Coogler and the cast have made it clear that <a href=#>they intended to honor Boseman</a> — who is survived by wife <a href=#><strong>Simone Ledward</strong></a> — with the final cut.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Black-Panther-Cast-Honored-Chadwick-Bosemans-Legacy-During-Comic-Con-Appearance-01.jpg><p class=p1>“It’s going to be interesting to surpass the cultural phenomenon that it was. It’s going to be really interesting to see how we do that again,” Bassett, 63, <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in May 2021</a>. “It’s going to be phenomenal and <a href=#>it’s going to pay tribute</a> and it’s going to carry on that legacy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<a href=#><i>9-1-1&nbsp;</i></a>actress added at the time: “[Chadwick]<a href=#> could do anything he put his mind to</a>. He could rap, he could dance like <a href=#>James Brown</a>. He could hold the center of a movie [as] the cinema’s first black superhero. He could do it all and he can inspire us to live our best.
