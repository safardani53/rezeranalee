Do you have to be famous famous for this Raya thing."</p><p>Armie then allegedly sent a photo, to which the friend asked, "Same girl?" and the actor appeared to confirm: "Same girl."</p><p>He then allegedly said: "That was just the one [knot].

Taken the casual thing well?" to which Armie allegedly replied: "She ended up not liking it."</p><p>The friend later discussed their reported conversation with someone else, saying: "I feel terrible about my casual response to him sending me nudes of people. But I can see that now."</p><p>The pal claimed they'd been sent a picture of Paige "tied up" and her "stood in front of a mirror", before adding: "Then some others from when he signed up to Raya [celebrity dating app]."</p><p>The Sun has reached out to Armie's rep for comment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000632027842-1.jpg><p>Paige spoke exclusively to The Sun over the weekend about how Armie allegedly <a href=#>kept mannequins in his basement</a> to practice tying up women and talked about wanting to strangle his dog.</p><p>She claims he was obsessed with "meat, bones and veins," and wanted her to be proud of the bruises she sustained as a result.</p><p>"He told me that he had mannequins in his basement in his family home that Elizabeth and him were living at to practice rope tying on," Paige told The Sun.</p><p>"It creeped me out, honestly. It was really strange.

And there is power in numbers."</p><p>She added: "I think that this [situation] is terrible, it's so unfair on his children and I think everyone is just so disgusted and shocked."</p><p>Paige also claims&nbsp;<a href=#>the 6ft 5in actor</a>&nbsp;would talk about strangling his own pet dog during bursts of anger, although she says she never saw him do it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000630467368-5.jpg><p>Hammer has often been seen walking his adorable pet pooch, Archie, a Welsh Terrier, near his $5million Hancock Park home in Los Angeles - which is now up for sale.</p><p>"He would get angry at his dog and say like, I'm going to kill this dog, I would have strangled him if you weren't here," Paige claimed to The Sun.</p><p>She says she brushed it off as a joke, but&nbsp;<a href=#>the star allegedly loved to inflict pain</a>&nbsp;on her and would often wrap his hands around her throat, bite and squeeze her during sex.</p><p>Paige claims <a href=#>he was into 'knife play'</a> and&nbsp;<a href=#>carved the letter 'A'&nbsp;into her skin</a> above her pubic bone before licking the bloody wound and "bragging" about it to his friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000468606939-3.jpg><p>She claimed he also fantasized about having sex with a “limp body” and their brief romance has left her “sick to the stomach.”</p><p>Following these accusations, an attorney for Mr. Hammer told The Sun: “These assertions about Mr. Hammer are patently untrue. Any interactions with this person, or any partner of his, were completely consensual in that they were fully discussed, agreed upon, and mutually participatory.</p><p>"The stories being perpetuated in the media are a misguided attempt to present a one-sided narrative with the goal of tarnishing Mr. Hammer’s reputation, and communications from the individuals involved prove that.”</p><p>Paige, who says Armie first reached out via Instagram, previously claimed he went as far as to ask her to find a doctor to remove her ribs so he could eat them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000377229983-4.jpg><p>Paige told The Sun: "I didn't think he was being serious, but the end of our relationship, it definitely seemed like he was being really serious about it.</p><p>a"And then of course, when the other woman came out, it really drove home to me that this is reccurring behavior and this is dangerous and scary.</p><p>Armie is currently holed up in the Cayman Islands as his divorce from ex,&nbsp;<a href=#>Elizabeth Chambers</a>, goes through the courts in LA and they battle for custody of their two young children.</p><p>A number of Armie's exes have com forward with claims about the actor since the scandal broke earlier this month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000630308607-16.jpg><p><a href=#>Courtney Vucekovich</a>&nbsp;alleged that he told her he wanted to “break and eat her ribs."</p><p>She told the DailyMail: “He was really into saying he wants to break one of your ribs and eat it. Like barbecue it and eat it. In terms of the BDSM stuff, he made that pretty clear that it is something he is interested in very early on in the relationship and he referenced breaking my ribs often.”</p><p>Courtney alleged that she felt as if she had been groomed by the actor and needed to undertake a 30-day intensive course of therapy for trauma and PTSD to deal with the repercussions after their breakup in early October.</p><p>He has been <a href=#>investigated by police</a> for posting a video of a lingerie-clad woman on all fours in his Cayman Island hotel room.</p><p>The images, which were leaked from his&nbsp;<a href=#>private Instagram account</a>, showed the actor refer to the person in underwear as “Miss Cayman”.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Armie&nbsp;<a href=#>finally broke his silence last week</a>&nbsp;to call the allegations a "vicious online attack" against him.</p><p>In his statement, he also revealed that he'd been ousted from playing the love interest in&nbsp;<a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a>'s new&nbsp;<a href=#>rom-com Shotgun Wedding</a>.</p><p>He told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>: "I’m not responding to these bulls**t claims but in light of the vicious and spurious online attacks against me.
