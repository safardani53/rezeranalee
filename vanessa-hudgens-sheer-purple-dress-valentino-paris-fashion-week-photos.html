With her trademark raven tresses tied back in a bun and minimal makeup, Vanessa allowed her natural beauty to shine. She topped off the high end look with a simple set of sparkling earrings and camel high heels.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The risqué outfit giving fans a peek at her bare nipples seems quite on brand for Vanessa, as she has been a stanch supporter of the braless look in the past. “Free the nipple! Bras are uncomfortable,” she said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Glamour UK</a> magazine, which was part of their Dec. 2021 cover story. “If you feel more comfortable and ready to take on the world in a bra, then by all means wear one. But for me personally, they’re just <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>not comfortable</a>. I don’t want to feel restricted.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Women used to have to be more covered up,” the actress added, pointing out how the attitude towards playing demure has changed over the years. “And I feel like it’s a lot more accepting of women to express themselves how they feel fit,” she explained.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Meanwhile, the star has been going from strength to strength with 25-year-old, MLB player boyfriend <strong>Cole Tucker</strong>. &nbsp;A few months ago, an insider told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY that their relationship <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>is better than ever!</a>&nbsp;“Cole treats Vanessa like a queen, he adores her,” the source said. “He has been very serious about her from the get-go and that has not wavered. He adores her and says all the time that she is his dream girl, it’s sweet.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e49vZq%2BZnprAtK2Moaydn5WjwG6%2Fx56cq2Wgqr%2BxuMRmm6udo6h6t63LnqWtoZ6kerGt0aKqZp6RqLWqu81mrp6dm2K9qbvTqKpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
