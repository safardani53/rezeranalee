Early voting starts TODAY in Tennessee and goes to Nov 1.”</p><p>Taylor even included with these words a link to a Vote.org page that offers information on early voting across the country.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Swift, of course, remained notoriously quiet about her political affiliations and preferences during the 2016 Presidential Election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.</p><p>She came under an unusual amount of fire for this indecision as well.</p><p>Apparently inspired to put an end to the misogyny/insanity/racism/total and complete chaos under the Donald Trump administration, however, Wfit stunned the world several days ago when <a href=#>she posted an endorsement of two Democrats in Tennessee</a> on her social media page.</p><p>This is what Swift wrote at the time:</p><p><strong>I’m writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which I’ll be voting in the state of Tennessee.</strong></p><p><strong>In the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now.</strong></p><p><strong>I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent</strong></p><p><strong>I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn.</strong></p><p><strong>As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me.</strong></p><p><strong>She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape.</strong></p><p><strong>She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry.</strong></p><p><strong>These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives.</strong></p><p><strong>Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values.</strong></p><p><strong>For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In response to Taylor’s unexpected foray into the world of politics, <a href=#>thousands and thousands of people registered to vote</a>.</p><p>Despite endlessly promoting and bragging about Kanye West’s love of President Trump, however, Republicans for some reason decided to slam Swift for expressing her view.</p><p>They dismissed her as an out-of-touch and ignorant musician who is rich and famous and who therefore cannot relate to the common voter in any way, shape or form.</p><p>This is what Trump himself said about the pop star:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But Swift appears to be undeterred.</p><p>As she accepted the artist of the year trophy at the American Music Awards last week, Swift again reminded her fans to vote.</p><p>"I just wanna say to the fans … you have been so nice to me and fun, and you’re so funny and you’re so cool and so loyal,” she said om stage, adding:</p><p>"Every time that you have made me lucky enough to ever get to stand on a stage and have something really sparkly in my hands … it means something different.</p><p>"This time, I just want you to know it means encouragement … for me to be better, work harder and to make you guys proud as much as I possibly can.</p><p>"This award and every single award given out tonight were voted on by the people, and you know what else is voted on by the people is the midterm elections on Nov. 6.</p><p>"Get out and vote.
