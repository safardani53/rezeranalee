Billie Eilish proved that she can rock baggy clothes just as well as a bustier and major baubles on the June 2021 cover of British Vogue. 
The 19-year-old singer looked totally transformed for the photo shoot — and it might have a little something to do with the fact that she was draped in more than $81,775 worth of diamonds! 
Yes, that’s right. Eilish was given major glitz to go with her gorgeous glam — courtesy of Jacquie Aiche, a fine jewelry brand."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Eilish was given major glitz to go with her gorgeous glam — courtesy of <a href=#>Jacquie Aiche</a>, a fine jewelry brand. The jewels were dainty and delicate, just adding a little extra oomph to her variety of designer outfits.</p><p class=p1>On the cover, the “Bad Guy” singer stunned in a pinup-inspired corset and skirt custom made by Gucci. Her standout bling for the look? An $18,000 diamond bra, which features round, marquise and teardrop cut diamonds.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>For the look, the star, who will be <a href=#>cohosting the 2021 Met Gala</a>, also donned two of the brand’s finger bracelets, ringing up at $10,250 and $8,750 respectively.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>While the cover was certainly a statement-making image (it basically broke the internet), there were, of course, a few more photos in the spread — and there was no shortage of bling!<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Billie-Eilish-Wears-80K-Jewelry-On-British-Vogue-Cover-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>Take the boudoir-inspired picture, where Eilish rocks an Alexander McQueen corset dress, for example. She’s covered in diamond necklaces, totaling up to nearly $123,900.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>We’d be remiss not to mention the two lingerie-clad photos from the feature. In both the custom Burberry corset that gave a partial view of Eilish’s mysterious leg tattoo and the custom Mugler catsuit, diamond rings took center stage.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>With baubles from both Anito Ko and Jacquie Aiche, there was certainly no shortage of sparkle. Seriously, Jacquie Aiche supplied more than $14,000 of diamond rings!<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Bling aside, the catsuits and lingerie were quite a departure from Eilish’s traditionally baggy clothes. Back in 2019, Eilish opened up about why she intentionally chose to wear oversized attire.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“I never want the world to know everything about me,” the star said in a <a href=#>video for Calvin Klein</a>. “I mean, that’s why I wear big baggy clothes: Nobody can have an opinion because they haven’t seen what underneath.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>That in mind, the “Therefore I Am” was anticipating a bit of backlash surrounding her corset-clad photo shoot, noting that people may see it as a contradiction to her claims of “body positivity.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>In response, she said: “It’s all about what makes you feel good. I you want to get surgery, go get surgery. If you want to wear a dress that somebody thinks that you too big wearing, fuck it — if you feel like you look good, you look good.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5e2rbjInmSeoZyewKm%2FjK%2BmoK2VYrCwwsSrZJ2hkaK8r7DSZqGer5Whv7p7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
