I’ve had times where I feel like I need to be rushed to the hospital because I think that my heart’s failing and I can’t breathe and I need someone to help me,” the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>818 tequila founder</a> explained. “Sometimes I think I’m dying, sometimes parts of my body will go numb. It can be really intense and scary.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Although she acknowledges her many privileges — the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>KarJenner family</a> are one of the wealthiest and most affluent in the world — Kendall hopes people will understand she’s also human. “There [are] going to be those people that say, ‘What does she have to worry about? What does she have to be anxious about?’ And I’ll never sit here and say I’m&nbsp;not fortunate…[but] I’m still a human being at the end of the day,” she said in the clip.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/kendall-jenner-anxiety-attacks-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>“And no matter what someone has or doesn’t have, it doesn’t mean they don’t have real-life feelings and emotions,” Kendall explained. In the first episode, she sits down with <strong>Dr. Ramani Durvasula</strong> to discuss social anxiety.&nbsp; “One of the most important things, I think, is to destigmatize all mental health issues, particularly anxiety, because a lot of people think they’re alone with it,” the Los Angeles–based psychologist said. “Anxiety is like a magnifying glass. It magnifies only the bad things … in essence, what we’re trying to do is take that magnifying glass and put it to being a regular lens.” Watch the full video above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH12e49vZqSdnpmurbiMo5ynppWneqK616KcrbFdpa6vtcJmmK2skZi4tHnVopuep18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
