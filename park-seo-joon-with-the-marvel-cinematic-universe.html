In an interview with The Guardian, the actor said he “couldn’t believe” someone from the MCU had approached him about a job. His anxious giggles showed he was also attempting to dodge Marvel-related trick questions. Excellent ENT confirmed rumors of the Itaewon Class actor joining the cast only in September last year, after rumors of his involvement had circulated since July. For years, the actor has been Korea’s heartthrob, and he is now the third South Korean actor to join the MCU, after Claudia Kim and Ma Dong-Seok.</p><h2>Marvel and Park Seo-Joon? The actor discusses receiving a call from the comic giant.</h2><p>Park Seo-entrance Joon’s into Hollywood with an MCU film rocked the K-drama industry and fans. After months of silence, the actor seems ready to answer and evade specific Marvel-related queries. In a recent interview, the 33-year-old actor expressed his surprise at getting a phone call from the MCU team. Even though he was merely talking about the conversation, he was cautious not to reveal any specifics about the project, which made him uneasy, according to The Guardian.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Park-Seo-Joon-2.jpg alt="Park Seo Joon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“I couldn’t believe it when I initially heard that the Marvel Cinematic Universe wanted to meet with me. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I’m simply trying to be cautious when it comes to Marvel-related inquiries [laughs nervously].”</p><p>The Fight For My Way actor discussed shooting anxieties on a foreign set and how the crew made him feel at ease.</p><p>“I’m not afraid of obstacles, but whether I’m shooting in South Korea or overseas, everything is a challenge for me.” So I did have some jitters at first. But everyone was so kind and helpful that I was able to settle in fast.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Park-Seo-Joon-3.jpg alt="Park Seo Joon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The actor allegedly came to London in September last year to shoot The Marvels.
