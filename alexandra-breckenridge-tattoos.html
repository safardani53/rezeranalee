She tends to cover up the majority of her tattoos while she's working, but occasionally they're visible at awards shows.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Additionally, you can spot smaller tattoos in her Instagram photos, like a spider on her toe, or a small crown on her forearm. For The Walking Dead, she sported some fake tattoos on her other arm, both of which are visible in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this photo</a> (warning: fake blood!).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While Alexandra has been very tight-lipped about the meaning behind these tattoos, we can only assume they are deeply personal!

Currently starring on Virgin River, Alexandra plays main character Melinda "Mel" Monroe, a nurse practitioner and midwife who recently moved to Virgin River, Calif., from Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p><p>Also starring in the new Netflix romantic drama is <a href=#>Martin Henderson</a>, who fans will recognize as Dr. Nathan Riggs on Grey's Anatomy. Martin's character, Jack, is a former U.S. Marine and bar owner who suffers from PTSD.&nbsp;</p><p>The show explores the relationship between Jack and Mel as they work through personal trauma and everyday hardships.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>After the success of Season 1, it's clear that Alexandra is excelling in the drama genre as much as she thrived in horror. Season 2 of Virgin River was released on Nov. 27, 2020, with several new additions to the cast. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline reports</a> Sarah Dugdale has been upgraded to series regular to face off against Alexandra's Mel.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Dugdale's character has been described as, "Lizzie, a powder keg of cunning, beauty and unbridled impulsivity, who blows into the small town of Virgin River like a tornado after her parents ship her off in the wake of a shoplifting bust."&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds like Mel won't be the only character working through familial and personal issues this season!&nbsp;</p><p>Clearly, Alexandra has proven her ability to excel in any genre she's given, indicated, in part, by her number of creative tattoos. Whatever she decides to do next, fans are sure the experience will be as multi-talented as she is!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmmxMCnm6uZXZe%2Fpq%2FKnqWroZScsm7AwK2rqKej</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
