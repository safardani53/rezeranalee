But when I first met my husband, he told me he always packs a bathing suit no matter where he is going,” she recalled. “I thought that was really silly, but you never know when you’re going to need a bathing suit. There have been many random occasions where we have gone somewhere, and I wish I have packed a bathing suit only to find that my husband did and I did not. It takes very little room. Pack that bathing suit.”</p><p>Conrad also dished to Us during her “25 Things You Don’t Know About Me” interview that her “favorite song” from her husband’s band days is “I Woke Up in a Car.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lauren-Conrad-and-Husband-William-Tell-s-Relationship-Timeline-2.jpg><h3><strong>September 2023</strong></h3><p>“It was a good Summer 🤍 Long beach days with friends, fire pit s’mores, family trips, a late summer garden and an adorable new family member,” Conrad wrote via Instagram, recapping her family’s summer adventures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lauren-Conrad-and-Husband-William-Tell-s-Relationship-Timeline.jpg><h3><strong>January 2024</strong></h3><p>While reflecting on the past year, Conrad shared <a href=#>a glimpse at her romance</a> with Tell.
