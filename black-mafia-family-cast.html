But in the last couple of months, they have signed on a couple of extremely well-known celebrities to play some of the main roles.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of 2020 and at the beginning of 2021, they acquired Russell Hornsby, Steve Harris, Michole Briana White, Ajiona Alexus, Eric Kofi-Abrefa, and Myles Truitt as series regulars and Kash Doll as a recurring star.</p><p>And to make it more exciting, in March 2021, they added Snoop Dogg, La La Anthony, and Serayah for recurring guest roles. But that wasn't the icing on the cake though!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Black Mafia Family (@blackmafiafamily)</a></p></figure><p>The main characters — the brother duo, Demetrius "Big Meech" Flenory, and &nbsp;Terry "Southwest T" Flenory — will be portrayed by Demetrius “Lil Meech” Flenory Jr. (aka the real-life, biological son of "Big Meech") and Da’Vinchi.&nbsp;</p><p>Lil Meech playing his father in this show will be his acting debut.

In the early 2000s, they also had a relationship with the hip hop industry as Demetrius created BMF Entertainment — an agency and record label.</p><p>When Demetrius created a space in the entertainment world, the brothers formed relationships with popular artists like E40, Trina, and T.I. to name a few. They promoted, under BMF, top-charting musicians like Fabolous and Young Jeezy.&nbsp;</p><p>BMF really made a name for itself in Hollywood. But it turned out that he didn't create BMF to develop a career in the music space. It turned out to be a front for his and his brother's drug business.</p><p>They are both currently still serving time with Terry in home confinement due to health reasons. Demetrius is behind bars and hopes to be released by 2032.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7mir8pmpJqemZZ6p63MoqOyZZOWwLU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
