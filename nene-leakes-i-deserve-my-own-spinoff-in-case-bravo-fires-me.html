As concerns about her Peach mount, NeNe is reportedly desperate for job security … and wants her very own spinoff.
A report last week claimed that NeNe Leakes had been fired by Bravo, not invited to return for Season 13."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

for a shot at a spinoff.</p><p>E! is one of the few networks with programming so similar and compatible with Bravo’s and the budget to potentially pay NeNe.</p><p>However, the report says that E! was simply not interested in an all-NeNe show, and didn’t think that their audience would be, either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The other problem is the same issue that has NeNe reportedly balking at signing on for Season 13 — her contract.</p><p>It has been reported that Housewives have to sign no-compete clauses as part of their contracts, barring them from other reality gigs without Bravo’s permission.</p><p>We have to imagine that NeNe’s beefy contract had a similar clause.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/05/nene-leakes-speaks-at-the-aftershow.png><p>That doesn’t mean that NeNe has exhausted her options, but … she may have to swallow her pride and sign the contract.</p><p>Whatever her new situation may be, whether it’s taking a pay cut or simply not getting a mega-raise, sounds better than losing her Peach.</p><p>Yes, NeNe did once negotiate a massive raise after taking one season off. But times have changed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/05/nene-leakes-speaks-at-the-aftershow.png><p>Just a couple of years ago, no one would have dared suggest that NeNe take a pay cut.</p><p>Now, reports say that she is being asked to make significantly less money to continue on the show.</p><p>In other words, this is the same thing that happened to Kenya Moore in Season 11.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>What’s interesting is that NeNe and Kenya’s fights have been directly linked to a huge ratings surge in Season 12.</p><p>Their explosive fights are eye-catching. Eye-catching means more ratings. Ratings mean more money.</p><p>So why would Bravo even risk NeNe walking away and costing them those sweet, sweet viewers?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Our guess is that Bravo knows that the same storyline can and will get old. It&nbsp;</p><p>Vicki Gunvalson’s final couple of seasons in Orange County were filled with drama, and she often took center stage.</p><p>But her endless fights with Kelly Dodd were nothing new, and they showed the OG of the OC the door. Is NeNe next?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Presumably, not if she signs on with whatever Bravo is offering her.</p><p>If she is once again a ratings juggernaut, she can always renegotiate for a whopping salary boost next time.</p><p>In the mean time, wouldn’t she prefer to retain her Peach and see where this next year takes her? Most people would literally kill for a job like hers.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>The Real Housewives of Instagram RANKED: Which Star is Most Popular?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2WDcLrEp5xmpJWWuKa%2FjKJknZ2jmr%2B3sYymsGanp6N6tLzIp6afnl2eu26vwKycZpqilsOwecWiqZ6rXaKycA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
