Besides Mike, his parents had three other kids, namely Jared, Chelsey, and Ryan.</p><p>He grew up in a small town named Mitchell and initially attended the local elementary school for his education, just like his elder brothers did. Since their father, Tom Miller, was a headteacher at an elementary school, they did pretty well in their studies.</p><p>However, there was something more remarkable that they inherited from their father. All the boys were excellent in sports as kids, and their father believed that it came down to them from him.</p><p>Tom was a leading basketball player during his college days at the Dakota Wesleyan University. Similarly, his brothers and nephews who lived nearby in the same town were all fond of basketball.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mike-Miller-with-his-eldest-brother-Ryan.jpg><p>So, young Mike grew up playing basketball with his brothers and cousins during his childhood. Besides basketball, he was very good at other sports such as baseball and football.</p><p>In 1994, Mike enrolled in Mitchell High School. It was the only high school in their district, and his brothers were playing there for the high school team. He joined his brothers and played with much older boys there.</p><p>Miller believes that his game got better because he got a chance to practice more with boys taller than him from an early age.&nbsp;</p><p>Mike reached the farthest among all siblings and retired as a successful NBA player. However, his older brothers, Ryan and Jared, played college basketball for the Northern State University and later became basketball coaches.</p><h2>&nbsp;Mike Miller | Basketball Career</h2><h3>College Career</h3><p>After completing his high school education, Mike enrolled at the University of Florida and played college basketball for the Gators.</p><p>The Gators’ head coach <a href=#>Billy Donovan</a> knew about him since his days in Mitchell School, and he was pretty sure Mike was the type to play in the NBA. As expected, Mike quickly rose to prominence by scoring points consistently for the Gators.</p><p>Even though they did not win any titles in his first season, he had a good time in which he averaged 12.2 points and 5.2 rebounds per game. Most importantly, he came into notice for his consistent three-pointers.</p><p>His sophomore season was better than his previous season as they made it to the NCAA tournament finals that season. Miller led the Gators that season averaging 14.1 points and 6.6 rebounds per game.</p><p>Sadly, the Michigan State Spartans stunned them in the finals and lifted the trophy. After his second season, Mike decided to forgo his last two college seasons and declared for the 2000 NBA draft.</p><p><a href=#>Also, please read about the American power forward <strong>Brandon Bass,</strong> who started his professional career in the NBA and later went on to win the CBA Slam Dunk Contest in 2018 here!</a></p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>The Orlando Magic chose him as the 2000 NBA draft’s fifth pick in the first round. Mike continued with the form and momentum in college into the NBA and had a fantastic rookie season.</p><p>He played all 82 games of the season and finished it with an average of 11.9 points and 4.0 rebounds per game.&nbsp;</p><p>The Magic had many small forwards in the 2002-03 season, so they decided to trade him to the Memphis Grizzlies in 2002.
