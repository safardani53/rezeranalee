The couple also had a son, Broderick Harvey Jr., 31, in 1991 before their divorce in 1994.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The talk show host welcomed another son, Wynton, 26, in 1997 with his second wife, Mary Shackelford, whom he was married to from 1996 to 2005.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Two years later, Steve wed Marjorie Harvey and adopted her three children from a previous relationship: daughters Morgan, 38, and Lori, 25, and son Jason, 31.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When you're dealing with a blended family, everyone is coming from a place of broken," Marjorie told PEOPLE in 2016 before explaining how she and Steve wanted to make sure all of their children felt included and loved.

Speaking to PEOPLE about that life-changing decision, he recalled, "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>I'm married, I have twins</a>. I'm supposed to provide for them, but I had to take this chance."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While he found success in the entertainment industry, it took a toll on his home life. He and Marcia divorced in 1994 and his relationship with Brandi and Karli was strained.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Years later they said to me, 'Dad, we didn't understand why you left us, but we know now you had to go. You didn't just belong to us. You belonged to the world,' " Steve shared, adding, "That was emotional for me."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2015, Karli married Ben Raymond and her father walked her down the aisle. Prior to the wedding, Karli and Benjamin appeared on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Steve's talk show</a> where the comedian tearfully admitted, "It's difficult to give your daughter away," before turning to Benjamin to add, "you have to take care of her, because if you don't, I'm going to take that personally."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The following June, Karli and Benjamin had their first child, a son named Benjamin Troy Raymond II. They decorated the nursery with a special token from their wedding, a blessing tree filled with messages from friends and family.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>I wanted to incorporate the blessing tree</a> so he always has that encouragement," Karli told PEOPLE in 2016. They also hung up one of Steve's favorite Albert Einstein quotes. "And then he made sure that the baby has a copy of his book, Act Like a Success," Karli shared.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Twin sister Brandi is an author, podcast host and fitness influencer who previously trained as a bodybuilder, even placing second in an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>NPC competition</a>.

Appearing on his father's talk show, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Steve</a>, in May 2019, Broderick opened up about their relationship, sharing, "I didn't really have my dad full-time in my life until I was 16."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In response, Steve spoke about his own regrets, saying, "I had spent my entire life trying to make up for the mistakes I made as a young man."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2015, Broderick started a shoe company called <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Steps By Stephens</a>, which helped fight hunger by donating three meals to a child in need for every pair sold.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The company has been featured on Steve's talk show. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Steve introduced Broderick</a> and his business partner saying, "The most important thing that I've tried to teach all of my kids is the value of hard work and giving back to others," before adding, "that's why I couldn't be prouder of my oldest son."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-wynton-harvey-26></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Wynton Harvey</strong>, 26</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Wynton Harvey Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wynton Brycelon Ali Harvey was born on July 18, 1997, to Steve and his second wife, Mary Shackelford. The couple divorced in 2005 after nine years of marriage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking to PEOPLE in 2016, Steve opened up about the divorce, saying "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>I got married for the wrong reasons</a>. I was tired of being alone. I have to own that. It was me, not her."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since their split, Mary has made numerous allegations against her ex-husband. In 2011, she claimed on YouTube that Steve cheated on her and took their son after their divorce. Steve responded to the accusations stating that he was awarded primary custody when Wynton was 13 years old and that their son went to live with him willingly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Today, Wynton is a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>photographer</a> based in Atlanta.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-morgan-hawthorne-38></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Morgan Hawthorne</strong>, 38</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Steve Harvey Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Marjorie welcomed her first child, Morgan, on May 14, 1985.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2019, Marjorie shared a heartfelt birthday message to her oldest daughter on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a>, writing "I was 19 years old when I became pregnant with you.....

In 2021, she launched her own skincare line, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>SKN</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But she's also made headlines due to a few high-profile relationships. Lori was pervasively engaged to Dutch professional soccer player Memphis Depay in 2017 and in 2019, she was linked to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sean "Diddy" Combs</a> as well as the rapper <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Future</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also had a serious relationship with actor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Michael B. Jordan</a>. The pair started dating in November 2020 before <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>ultimately calling it quits in June 2022</a>. A source close to the model told PEOPLE that Lori "wasn't ready to commit," and that "she is very focused on her career."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following their breakup, Steve shared his thoughts on his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>podcast</a> saying, "I'm team Lori, 1,000 percent. She's my daughter. I love her, I support her."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In January 2023, the Family Feud host said Lori was "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>in a really good place in her life right now</a>" during an appearance on Today with Hoda and Jenna.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm not allowed to talk about anything," he continued. "I've given her advice quite a few times but you know, it's difficult 'cause she's 25. She's growing up as a public figure. She doesn't get to make her mistakes like everybody else. Everybody else gets to make their mistakes in the cloak of darkness at your house. Hers gets publicized."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-92 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Steve added, "But she's done a really good job of figuring it out and getting it right. ...I think she's content with Lori and I think that's a great place for her to start from."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Jan. 13, 2023, Lori confirmed her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>relationship with actor Damson Idris</a> by posting a photo on her Instagram Story of Idris kissing her cheek, adding three heart emojis underneath. That weekend, the two arrived at her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>26th birthday party</a> hand-in-hand. Since then, Lori and Idris have made their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>red carpet debut</a> and were spotted at a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Beyoncé concert</a> and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>2023 Serpentine Summer Party</a> in London.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CWv6a606xmmqScYq6ju9StZKyslauybrTAq62esV2gtqW%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
