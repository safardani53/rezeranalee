Like, in the moment, right before he even watched himself back, he was able to check himself,” the Loverboy creative director, 31, exclusively told Us. “I think that’s huge and the two of them have only grown since then. Closer and stronger.”</p><p>The New Jersey native quipped: “We all have our <a href=#>little bumps in our road</a>, but Craig is not following in [my husband] <a href=#><strong>Kyle [Cooke]</strong></a>‘s footsteps [of being a] chaotic boyfriend.”</p><p>When it comes to the <a href=#>next steps in their relationship</a>, Amanda said she “can see” Paige moving from New York to Charleston, South Carolina.</p><p>“I don’t wanna support that move,” she joked. “I think that, you know, she would do great. I think Craig would get lost in the city.”</p><p>Ciara echoed her <a href=#>Summer House</a> costar’s sentiments, before admitting that she is also rooting for Craig to come to the Big Apple.</p><p>“I was like, ‘He needs the tough love of a big city where he is not a big fish in a small pond,’” the influencer told Us. “And I mean that will humble you in itself like that.”</p><p>Amanda, however, is pretty confident that it’ll be <a href=#>the “Giggly Squad” podcast cohost</a> that uproots her life if she and Craig continue to date.</p><p>“I feel like Paige will follow in her mom’s footsteps of these amazing, like, dinner parties and plate settings and all of her holiday events,” she explained. “I think that’s what Paige wants and she’ll get that down south.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While season 2 of Winter House is available to stream on Peacock, Summer House will return to Bravo in early 2023.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqimaKWeqK5wKebmmWglraosYycqZqhl2Kus7GMrKuipJxisaLAyKeeZpmWqbKzedaipa2domK1sMHSnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
