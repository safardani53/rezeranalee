Duchess Kate took a very obviously style cue out of Princess Diana’s fashion playbook this weekend. The 40-year-old royal showed up to the Guinness Six Nations Rugby Championship game in a houndstooth-print jacket that is nearly identical to the one her late mother-in-law wore to the same sports event (England vs. Wales) circa 1993. 
Unlike Princess Diana’s coat, Duchess Kate’s jacket was designed with a modern spin. The $600 Holland Cooper jacket had a fitted silhouette, whereas the late royal’s was a bit less structured."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Tell me again how Kate isn’t sick in the head,” a user wrote, while someone else said, “These matching outfits from Kate Middleton and Princess Diana are really making me want a houndstooth blazer.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The twinning moment between the two royals is amazing — but it’s certainly not the first time that the Hold Still author has taken style inspo from her mother-in-law.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>In fact, a similar situation came to pass a few months back. During the September 2021 premiere of No Time to Die, the duchess gave a subtle nod to the Princess of Wales in a glitzy gold gown. She opted for a Jenny Packham number that was eerily similar to the Bruce Oldfield number Princess Diana wore to the premiere of the 1985 Bond movie, A View to Kill.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Duchess Kate has longstanding style history of paying tribute to the late royal through fashion. She famously wore a red collared dress and coat when leaving the hospital with Prince Louis in 2018 that bared a striking similarity to the outfit Princess Diana wore when leaving the hospital with Prince Harry in 1984.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The Duchess of Cambridge also likes to honor her mother-in-law through jewelry. In addition to her stunning sapphire engagement ring, the duchess was given a handful of pieces form Princess Diana’s collection — and she makes a point to incorporate the stunning jewels with her outfits.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6CutbGMpqCdnJyawbC6jKCgr52jYsC1xcueZKenlGLBsHnPq6Cnm5WowG6wyJqlmmWRqXqzwcabsGalkamwqXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
