Jenelle and David’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>daughter</a>, <strong>Ensley Jolie</strong>, 6, looked like her mom’s mini-me in an adorable multi-patterned dress and sparkly white sneakers. Soon after the TV personality shared the post, many of her 3.1 million followers gushed over the happy family in the comments section. A plethora of them were excited to see Jace back in the picture, as Jenelle recently <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>regained custody</a> of him from <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her mother</a>, <strong>Barbara Evans</strong>, on Mar. 18.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Omg how cuuute [sic]!

Thanks everyone for the support! Words cant descibe [sic] how happy i truly am. Our family is complete now! Thank you mom,” she <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>captioned the video</a> of her signing the paperwork on Mar. 18. In the post, Jenelle was seen crying in her car after finding out that she officially got custody of Jace back.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“Ok so I just bawled my eyes out. You never gave up and that is what Jace will remember,” one fan commented on the adorable video, with another adding, “This literally makes me feel like we all won a long battle here.” Jenelle welcomed her son Jace when she was a senior in high school in 2010, with her then-beau <strong>Andrew Lewis</strong>. Her journey <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>into motherhood</a> was documented on&nbsp;16 and Pregnant, and later, on&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Teen Mom 2</a>. She recently spoke to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>US Weekly</a>&nbsp;about how her mother came to the decision of handing over the parental rights back to the 31-year-old. “My mom and I decided together to grant full custody back to me because we want to build our relationship back as mother and daughter,” she told the outlet on Mar. 18. “Also, my mother agrees it’s time for Jace to be back with his siblings and living with a mother and father.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH11e5BpZqOdnpq5rbGMnq2apqNiv6K%2BxGadmqWZocZuscCsq56qXaW1sMDOrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
