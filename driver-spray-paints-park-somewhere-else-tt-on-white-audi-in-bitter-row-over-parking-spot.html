The luxury vehicle was spray-painted with the message &#34;park elsewhere t**t&#34; across its bonnet, with the smutty note leaving witnesses stunned.
Meg House spotted the white Audi covered in the crass message as she walked home in Hampshire last week, saying she believed it had been inspired by an out-of-control parking dispute.
