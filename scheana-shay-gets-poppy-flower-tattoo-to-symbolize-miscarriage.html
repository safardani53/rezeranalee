It’s still been a lot to process.”</p><p>She continued at the time, “Now I’m at home and I’m just waiting to naturally miscarry. … I’m just literally sitting here waiting, feeling normal but still treating my body as if I’m pregnant, which is a complete mindf—k because I know there’s still something there, but I haven’t passed it yet.”</p><p>Shay added that she is still “so happy” for her former Vanderpump Rules costar <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Stassi Schroeder</strong></a>, who is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">expecting her first child </a>with her fiancé, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Beau Clark.</strong></a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Days later, the California native explained <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">why it was important for her</a> to share the news with her fans.</p><p>“I just really wanted to get my story out my way,” Shay said on the July 3 episode of her “Scheananigans” podcast. “I didn’t want to do an interview, have it manipulated, soundbites taken here and there.
