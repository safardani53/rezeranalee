The Gist: 
A video went viral of a PR person and a girl getting into a fight at NYFW afterparty. An influencer was trying to get into the party, offended the PR person, and got denied entry. The PR person just happens to be a big deal and runs doors at top clubs all over the city."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The fits, the celebrities, the pomp, and the circumstance. Anna Delvey having a <a href=#>NYFW fashion show on her roof</a> since she's on house arrest. It is truly giving us everything we want.</p><p>You know what else it's giving? The drama. And this time is at the door of a NYFW afterparty between a very powerful PR rep and an influencer trying to get into the party.</p><p>What actually happened? We explain it all below.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why was there a fight between a girl and PR person at a NYFW afterparty?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The video posted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@shopsyro</a> on <a href=#>TikTok</a> has 9.4 million views as of writing this article. It shows a man whom the creator calls "Mullet Babe" and a woman fighting at a door.</p><p>In the video, we hear Mullet Babe say, "You're from Canada so you don't f--king know. That's why you're not coming in. You're not welcome because I don't like you." The woman says, "You are not the <a href=#>PR person</a>," to which Mullet Babe says, "I am a PR person you dumb f--k."</p><p>As the video continues, Mullet Babe goes, "I wish you well," over and over and the woman says that she isn't speaking to him. The woman ends up leaving because she can't get into the party.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The creator of TikTok replied to a comment with another video explaining the context of what went down:</p><p>"OK. So here's what happened. Everybody was waiting in line. We're outside an afterparty for something. And then this girl, super rude to everyone, cuts the entire line and then demands that she's a paid influencer. What's a <a href=#>paid influencer</a>? Screaming that she's getting paid. She needs to be inside... and then she turns around and points at the rest of us waiting in line and being like, 'I'm being paid to be here, unlike these moochers.'"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>@shopsyro was very much on the side of the PR person at the door, saying that the woman was the villain.</p><p>And who is the woman you ask? She goes by @moxeb on both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> and has a pretty big following: 191.7K on TikTok and 63.1K on Instagram.</p><p>But more importantly, who is Mullet Babe? Well, that is one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Markus Kelle</a>. And he not only is a doorman, he is THE doorman. So much so, that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a> has even written about him.</p><p>So maybe @moxeb was supposed to be paid to be at that party, but if you're rude to Markus, you aren't getting in. Sorry babe, but we wish you well.</p><p>Markus has already made <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">merch</a> from his viral fight with his one-liners "I wish you well," and "I'm matching your volume" and we are here for it. Get your bag, King.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo8anw4ypqWafmae5brLIoJ%2BtZZWtva2tyKecnQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
