The film is being produced by Illumination (who handles the animation) and Nintendo, while Universal Pictures is the distributor.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>During a Q&A at Nintendo’s Feb. 20220 investor’s meeting, Shigeru Miyamoto explained that the virtual console inspired him to create the film. “Basically, it’s not that I want to make a&nbsp;Mario movie’, but that I began to consider that we should bring more Nintendo content into the field of video-making. With films, the amount of people who would contact our IP would widen, and increase the amount of people engaging with our IP. Then, we’d be able to further increase the spread of our media via video,” he said in the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>interview</a>.</p><h2>Production Trivia</h2><p id=content-paragraph-18>Nintendo and Illumination began discussions about creating the film in 2016. After four years of negotiations, Nintendo president&nbsp;<strong>Shuntaro Furukawa&nbsp;</strong>confirmed that the movie was happening with an expected 2022 release date. The full cast has already done their voice work for the film. Charlie Day, who is voicing Luigi, told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Screen Rant&nbsp;</a>in Feb. 2022 that the job was super secretive. “I know so little about the movie because it’s like the Marvel Universe. They released to me very specific lines, and they call me in and say, “Say Mario 7000 different ways and then we’ll pick which one we want,’ ” Charlie said. “So I know almost nothing. I’m not in the inner circle of the Nintendo World.”</p><h2>Storyline</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-19>No plot details have been released about the&nbsp;<i>Super&nbsp;Mario&nbsp;</i>movie, but as you can see in the trailer above, it’ll obviously feature a duel between Mario and Bowser. Nintendo released the first teaser poster for the film on October 4. The poster features Mario standing in his signature outfit staring up at Princess Peach’s castle from the streets of Mushroom Kingdom. Mario is surrounded by a group of Toads. Nintendo also dropped the first teaser trailer at New York Comic Con on October 6.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>If past&nbsp;Mario&nbsp;projects are any indication, then this new film will probably feature Mario rescuing Princess Peach from Bowser with help from Luigi and his allies. The romantic relationship between Mario and Peach will definitely be an important aspect of the film, as well. We can’t wait for this movie to arrive!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yaqaKnXaK8t7XEZpqaq6RigXiCmGlqbWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
