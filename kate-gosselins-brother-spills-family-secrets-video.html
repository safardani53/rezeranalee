They are known to many because they were often featured on the TLC reality show Jon & Kate Plus 8, and referred to on camera as Uncle Kevin and Aunt Jodi.</p><p>The couple used to host the kids at their home when <strong>Jon Gosselin</strong> and his wife were out of town. Jodi and her daughter also traveled with the family when they ventured to Utah, Florida, New York and Chicago.</p><p>Rumors have been circulating that Kate is now estranged from her brother and his wife because she would not accept their criticism about some of the things that have been occurring in their lives.</p><p>Kevin and Jodi spoke to <a href=# title=radaronline rel=noopener>radaronline.com</a> and have provided a very candid view of what things are really like within the Gosselin household. Their reluctant testimony paints a picture of a deteriorating relationship that Kevin suggests has turned the Gosselin family home into a dysfunctional living situation for the children.</p><p>Kevin said that Jon visited them six months ago and said that he suspected his wife was having an affair with <strong>Steve Neild </strong>– <a href=# title="pics steve" rel=noopener>photos here</a>. <strong></strong>He also said that the marriage was over.</p><p>Jodi had a hard time verbalizing what is going on, and it is quite obvious that it pains this couple greatly to be involved in this interview. She did say, “The show is not reality and hasn’t been for a long time. This is a train wreck.”</p><p>It didn’t take TLC long to issue a statement of their own, <a href=# title="tlc says no" rel=noopener>refuting these statements</a> by Kevin and Jodi.</p><p>Kevin admits that he has talked to the crew that films the Gosselin’s reality show, and they are finding it increasingly difficult to get 15 minutes of usable video from eight hours of filming because of the constant bickering that is “too real and strained”, by TLC standards. See <a href=# title=recap rel=noopener><strong>NEW first episode photos and recap</strong></a> from May 25, 2009 premiere.</p><p>We were shocked and saddened by what Kevin and Jodi had to say. We found them to be caring individuals who appear to be truly concerned about the Gosselin family. <a href=# title="kevin link" rel=noopener>LINK HERE.</a></p><p><strong>UPDATE: May 27, 2009</strong></p><p>The couple sat down for a new candid conversation with CBS co-anchor <strong>Harry Smith </strong>on The Early Show today.<strong> </strong>The segment revealed that the Kreider’s believe the Gosselin children are being exploited and they claim that Jon and Kate have turned a blind eye.</p><p>According to Jodi, “They’re being exploited and it’s time for America to see the situation for what it really is, which is unfortunately, there are no laws protecting children in reality TV shows. And it’s time for the public to be aware of this.”</p><p>Kevin and Jodi were particularly troubled by the television cameras having access to the children’s bedrooms. They believe that it is dangerous on several levels. They are adamant that everything that the family does is organized by production companies and intended for ratings. Kevin is certain that the children will come to see that all of their childhood memories were manufactured for television.</p><p>The couple fears that their nephews and nieces are going to suffer serious life consequences based on the way that their parents are using them for significant financial gain.
