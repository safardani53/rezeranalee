Kenya had kept her relationship with Marc so quiet that we didn’t even know his name for a while! Rumors flew that she might get fired by Bravo because she didn’t give producers any warning about her secret nuptials. Kenya has finally become an official housewife so we’re hoping she gets to stick around.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The newly wed bride looked like she didn’t have a care in the world in her breath-taking wedding photos. Her Instagrams from the wedding have been absolutely melting our hearts. Kenya wore a stunning breezy white gown for her big that perfectly fit her beachy venue. It hugged her every curve and she was absolutely glowing. “A good man is hard to find but true love is even harder. I found both,” she captioned one beautiful photo of herself walking hand-in-hand with Marc. Kenya seemed positively thrilled to have found her true love. These two couldn’t possibly get any cuter! “I’m just ecstatic,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. “This man is the love of my life and I’m so happy to begin our lives together as husband and wife.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do you think of Kenya’s wedding bling?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH14e49qZqSdnq6ubrnOqKmeZZSerq67zZ1kq6GenHqztM6aZJ6ro5q7pLGMn5ysrJmrrq15z6KaaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
