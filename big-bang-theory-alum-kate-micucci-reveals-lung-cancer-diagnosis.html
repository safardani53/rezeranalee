And I was very lucky to find it so early.”</p><p>Original story:</p><p>Actress and comedian <strong>Kate Micucci</strong>’s recent health scare took her by surprise.</p><p>“Hey everybody. This is not a TikTok, it’s a ‘Sick Tok.’ I’m in the hospital but it’s because I had lung cancer surgery yesterday,” Micucci, 43, revealed in a recent <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok</a> upload, which was filmed from her hospital bed. “They caught it really early. It’s pretty weird because I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life, so it was a surprise, but also, I guess it happens.”</p><p>Micucci — known for her role as Lucy on <a href=#>The Big Bang Theory</a> and as one half of the musical duo Garfunkel and Oates with <strong>Riki Lindhome</strong> — noted that she’s “all good” post-surgery, largely thanks to doctors catching the cancer at an early stage.</p><p>“It’s been a little bit of a trip and [I’ll] probably be moving slow for a few weeks, but then, I’ll be back at it. Can’t wait to be painting more, which I’ll be painting soon, I think,” she continued, before joking, “Why am I still talking? ‘Cause I’m on drugs.”</p><p>Micucci’s post featured a photo of herself holding up a cereal box and a banana while lying in bed, as well as a clip of her walking around the hospital in a gown with her IV drip. “Woo hoo!” she exclaimed as she walked down a hallway. “I gotta say, the artwork here is pretty nice.”</p><p>Several fans sent their well-wishes for the star in the TikTok’s comments. “First things first, glad you are OK, be strong, be you a happy person, for all of us,” one user wrote, while another commented, “National Treasure Kate Micucci … feel better fast!!!!!🥰.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Big-Bang-Theory-Alum-Kate-Micucci-Is-All-Good-After-Undergoing-Lung-Cancer-Surgery6.jpg><p>Fellow comedian <strong>Tom Green</strong> wrote, “Get well soon best wishes and good luck with your recovery.” Micucci responded to his kind words by writing, “Thank you, Tom! ❤️.”</p><p>Micucci hasn’t let her recent health scare stop her from celebrating the <a href=#>holiday season</a>. Prior to unveiling her cancer diagnosis, she released a sped-up version of her 2018 Christmas track, “You Got a Bike.”</p><p>“It’s a perfect song to rock out to at your holiday parties,” she captioned a pic of the song’s cover art, featuring a childhood photo of herself on a bike, via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on Friday, December 8. “Also, about this picture … I wore braids until I was 14. I’m 10 years old in the photo. I asked my mom to take it so I could have a headshot and send it to a talent agent. I lived in a small town in Pennsylvania but I was dreaming big 😎🌲❤️.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Big-Bang-Theory-Alum-Kate-Micucci-Is-All-Good-After-Undergoing-Lung-Cancer-Surgery5.jpg><p>Micucci has racked up over 150 acting credits, including a lot of voiceover work, over the years since making her TV debut in a 2006 episode of Malcolm in the Middle.
