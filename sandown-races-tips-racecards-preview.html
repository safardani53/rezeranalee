The ITV cameras are in town for a competitive eight race card, and our man Jack Keene has taken a close look at the card with his race-by-race preview.
Race 1 - 12.55 British Stallion Studs EBF Maiden Stakes Bungledupinblue was three places ahead of HAPPY ROMANCE when the pair met at Newmarket last week.
But the former enjoyed the run of the race on the stands rail while his well-punted rivals was out the back and endured a troubled run throughout."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Top-weight <strong>Well Of Wisdom</strong> brings some high-class form the to table and he was a Listed winner in Dubai when last sighted.</p><p>He has to concede weight to some nice types though and preference is for Marcus Tregoning's <strong>IMPRESSOR</strong>.</p><p>He was a very creditable third in the Horris Hill Stakes at Newmarket in November, when he raced alone and tried to make all the running on heavy ground.</p><p>The Footstepsinthesand colt will appreciate the forecast going and has undergone a wind op, while he is a likely pace angle at a front-runners track.</p><p><strong>Ascension</strong> is held in high regard by the Roger Varian team and he will surely prove better than his mark in time. But this demands a big step forward.</p><p><strong>Surf Dancer</strong> was behind the selection in the Horris Hill but is in good hands and will likely have more to offer as a three-year-old.</p><h3>SELECTION: Impressor</h3><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Race 4 - 2.40 Unibet Scurry Stakes (Listed)</a></h3><p>In truth, it's impossible to know what <strong>Sunday Sovereign</strong> will produce on his first start in almost a year.</p><p>He looked very exciting before bombing out at Royal Ascot and he has since joined Roger Varian. He could be a very smart sprinter for the future or he might've been a very forward two-year-old. We will find out today.</p><p><strong>DREAM SHOT</strong> was kept busy last season and ran plenty of solid races in Group company. He ran nicely to finish third in the Pavilion on his return and he is well-drawn in two. The drop to 5f is a plus.</p><p><strong>Lazuli</strong> is another who will likely appreciate the return to the minimum trip after a good second on his return over 6f at Newmarket.</p><p><strong>Al Raya</strong> won a Group 3 when we last saw her and she commands respect, but Simon & Ed Crisford's runners have yet to really get going since the resumption.</p><h3>SELECTION: Dream Shot</h3><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFER OF THE DAY</h3></p><p><strong>Bet £10 on the 4.00 Curragh & get a £5 free bet for each race on the 1000 Guineas card Saturday with Paddy Power <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://media.paddypower.com/redirect.aspx?pid%3D12984028%26bid%3D5601&source=gmail&ust=1591621148104000&usg=AFQjCNFuCaN7Wbys8E3jltHtpIafMADecA" data-mce-href="http://media.paddypower.com/redirect.aspx?pid=12984028&bid=7043">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p>18+ T&Cs apply Begambleaware.org</p><p>T&Cs: New customer offer.

Of the newcomers, Galileo colt <strong>Postileo</strong> is well worth a market check.</p><h3>EACH-WAY PLAY: Real Poet</h3><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Race 7 - 4.20 Oxshott Handicap (Div I)</a></h3><p>Plenty in with chances in a wide-open heat, but <strong>ROAR</strong> appeals most from an each-way perspective.</p><p>He lines up off a good mark under top jockey Silvestre De Sousa, and he advertised his well-being with a bumper win on the all-weather before lockdown.</p><p>Classy hurdler <strong>Leoncavallo</strong> lines up off a tempting mark on his debut for David Pipe, so he commands respect, while <strong>Seaborn</strong> and <strong>Fibonacci</strong> are also worth close consideration.</p><h3>EACH-WAY SELECTION: Roar</h3><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFER OF THE DAY</h3></p><p><strong>Bet £10 on the 4.00 Curragh & get a £5 free bet for each race on the 1000 Guineas card Saturday with Paddy Power <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://media.paddypower.com/redirect.aspx?pid%3D12984028%26bid%3D5601&source=gmail&ust=1591621148104000&usg=AFQjCNFuCaN7Wbys8E3jltHtpIafMADecA" data-mce-href="http://media.paddypower.com/redirect.aspx?pid=12984028&bid=7043">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p>18+ T&Cs apply Begambleaware.org</p><p>T&Cs: New customer offer.

Take a punt on <strong>VORASHANN</strong> on his stable debut for Gary Moore.</p><p>His trainer has an excellent record at this track and, though he showed little in three starts over timber, he showed ability on the level in France.</p><p><strong>Be Fair</strong> was in cracking form on the AW over the winter and he will surely go close if handling the switch back to turf. <strong>Atomic Jack</strong> and <strong>Blame It On Sally</strong> won't be far away either.</p><h3>EACH-WAY PICK: Vorashann</h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SEE ALL FREE BETS HERE</a></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Racing legend Frankie Dettori joins fight against coronavirus, donating 1,000 health drinks to NHS staff</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLWwvtKeqZqbmaO0cH2QcWtwb2NufLStzZ2msKZdp66ksdJmq6Koo2K%2Foq%2FEnJirnKNivbOx1aKcsGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
