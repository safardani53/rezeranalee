The SAG-AFTRA strike recently came to an end after more than 100 days, so most TV and movie projects have been put on hold for most of the summer.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Production on American Sports Story had started earlier this year, and it’s unclear how much filming was done before the double Hollywood strikes began. American Sports Story will likely premiere in late 2024.</p><h2>What Will ‘American Sports Story’ Be About?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>The first season of American Sports Story will chronicle <strong>Aaron Hernandez’s </strong>rise and fall. The season is based on the Boston Globe and Wondery podcast&nbsp;Gladiator: Aaron Hernandez and Football Inc.&nbsp;Aaron rose to sports fame as a tight end at the University of Florida and eventually the New England Patriots.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Off the field, Aaron found himself in serious legal troubles. He was found guilty of first-degree murder in 2015 and sentenced to life in prison for killing <strong>Odin Lloyd</strong>. He was also indicted for the 2012 double homicide of <strong>Daniel de Abreu</strong> and<strong> Safiro Furtado</strong>, but he was acquitted.

So I was just, ‘Yeah, this guy’s good. Check him out.’ And we just threw him in the mix. And he stole the part, just like he did Ballad,” Nina told IndieWire. “Especially having watched him on set, he is a grounded, likable, natural, and compelling presence, super-prepared. I was thrilled once they brought in a bunch of people, and let Josh rise to the top, which I knew he would. And we had him all tatted out. He was trained to be huge and muscular; he loved lifting weights.”</p><h2>‘American Sports Story’ Cast</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Josh will be joined by<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Patrick Schwarzenegger</strong></a>, who will play former quarterback <strong>Tim Tebow</strong>.
