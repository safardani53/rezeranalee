He was a mathematics prodigy, but abandoned his academic career in 1969 to pursue a more primitive life. Between 1978 and 1995, he killed three people and injured 23 others in a nationwide bombing campaign against people he believed to be advancing modern technology and the destruction of the environment. He issued a social critique opposing industrialization and advocating a nature-centered form of anarchism. In 1971, Kaczynski moved to a remote cabin without electricity or running water near Lincoln, Montana, where he lived as a recluse while learning survival skills to become self-sufficient. He witnessed the destruction of the wilderness surrounding his cabin and concluded that living in nature was becoming impossible, resolving to fight industrialization and its destruction of nature.</p><table class=wikibox readability=8><tr readability=7><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>Theodore John Kaczynski, May 22, 1942, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Other names</td><td class=wk_value>Unabomber, FC</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Occupation</td><td class=wk_value>Mathematics professor</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>Notable work</td><td class=wk_value>Industrial Society and Its Future (1995)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>Criminal penalty</td><td class=wk_value>8 consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Criminal status</td><td class=wk_value>Incarcerated at USP Florence ADMAX, #04475-046</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>Relatives</td><td class=wk_value>David Kaczynski (brother)</td></tr></table><p>Criminal Ted Kaczynski was born on May 22, 1942 in Illinois, United States (He dies at the age of 81, on June 10, 2023).</p><p>For 20 years, he was known as The Unabomber, and he orchestrated a mailbomb campaign against institutions and airplanes.</p><p>All information about Ted Kaczynski can be found in this post.
