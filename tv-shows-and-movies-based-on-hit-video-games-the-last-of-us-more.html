Ellie, however, is somehow immune to the disease and is the key to creating a potential cure.</p><p>The Last of Us became an instant success and received a season 2 renewal the same month it premiered. The series will <a href=#>continue to take inspiration from the original video game</a> and its 2020 sequel, which is still <a href=#>centered around Joel and Ellie but includes a time jump.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, Five Nights at Freddy’s consists of nine video games, which take place in locations connected to a fictional family pizza restaurant franchise titled Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. The story lines were <a href=#>condensed for the 2023 film featuring four animatronic mascots</a> as the main villains.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We really wanted this to be inclusive to a younger audience and there are so many younger fans with this franchise, but also certainly hope to have nailed some of the jump scares like playing the game.
