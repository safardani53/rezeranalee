"If you tend to get cold sores frequently, it's wise to keep antiviral topical or oral medications on hand to keep the virus from replicating."</p><p>People who aren't up for <a href=#>medications</a> can try at-home remedies instead. Products such as petroleum jelly and ibuprofen can help soothe the sore. You can even apply a damp washcloth on the affected area for relief.</p><p>"Rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide can help dry out the sore and speed up the healing process as well," Chen also recommended.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLytsIyspqudXaWys7LUppxmoJGYuG7AyKSrqKM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
