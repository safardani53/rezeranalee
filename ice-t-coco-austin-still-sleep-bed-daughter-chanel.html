I was there when Coco was pregnant, I went to the hospital, and Chanel still sleeps in the bed with us,” he explained on the May 9 episode of iHeartMedia’s Black Effect Podcast Network show, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>That Moment with Daymond John</a>. He made the admission after confessing that he is “so much more connected” to Chanel than <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his older kids</a>. He shares a 47-year-old daughter, <strong>Letesha</strong>, with his high school girlfriend <strong>Adrienne</strong>, and a 31-year-old son named <strong>Tracy</strong> with his ex, <strong>Darlene Ortiz</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Ice-T, 65, admitted that he was “distracted” by his career from being super hands-on with his first two children, and feels that having a kid in his “second half of life” was life-changing.&nbsp; “It made me want to live forever. It made me create new goals. It’s the best gift I could ever get,” he noted. The rapper welcomed Chanel into the world in 2015 when he was 57.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ice-T-coco-chanel-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Ice-T has been very open about how he and Coco, 37,&nbsp; parent <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their daughter</a> — despite the backlash that comes with it. In May 2o22, they were shamed by online trolls after they shared an image of then 6-year-old <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Chanel in a stroller </a>while&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>they were on vacation in The Bahamas</a>. Both of Chanel’s doting parents immediately clapped back.&nbsp;“Oh lord!! Really people? The world loves to criticize [literally] everything i do!” Coco <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a> at the time. “MFs ain’t got s—t else to talk about. F em all. Smh. Lol,” Ice-T slammed in his own <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweet</a>. A few months later, they caused commotion again after Coco posted a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TikTok video</a> that showed<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Chanel taking a bath in the sink</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>One year earlier, the “Colors” rapper and Coco made headlines after the latter revealed a then 5-year-old Chanel was still breastfeeding. “Chanel still likes my boobs. It’s a big bonding moment for a mother and your child,” Coco said while chatting with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a> in 2021. She said her breastmilk isn’t Chanel’s main source of food, but described it as “a little snack.” She added, “Why take that away from her? … If she doesn’t want it, all right, that’s where you stop it. But I’m not just going to say no.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The family of three made a public appearance together earlier this year at <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ice-T’s Walk of Fame ceremony</a>. During the February event, the Judgement Day actor mentioned his entire family. “Let me shout out my family,” he said,&nbsp; per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. “My son, my daughter, Coco my wife. [Chanel], who obviously is in the position to stand behind one of these podiums one day. She has no fear of the stage.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH12e49yZqKblWLBbq%2FOnKZmmaWowaq6jKyroqScYsCtscSpZJudlGKxosHGoaueql2YtaK6xKVm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
