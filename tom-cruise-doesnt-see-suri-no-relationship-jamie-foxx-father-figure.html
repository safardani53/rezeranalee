And while a new report claims the actor is contemplating leaving his religion in order to reunite with his little girl, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Katie Holmes</strong></a>, 39, is NOT holding her breath. Although Katie would love for her ex and their daughter to have a relationship again, she doesn’t believe the actor has what it takes to leave Scientology for good. Lucky for Suri though, she has a new father figure in her life now — Katie’s BF <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jamie Foxx</strong></a>, 50. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Click here to see adorable pics of Suri with Katie</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>“Katie would be thrilled to see Tom leave Scientology, she’d love to see him build a healthy relationship with&nbsp;Suri,” a source close to Katie told <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> EXCLUSIVELY.&nbsp;“It would be a dream come true actually, but she’s not&nbsp;expecting it. She has zero hope that Tom will leave Scientology for&nbsp;Suri —&nbsp;he’s made it clear many times over that he’s in it for life.” Even still though, certain individuals, like&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Leah Remini</strong></a>, 47, have indeed escaped the religion’s clutches. However, Katie seems to think Tom is in way too deep for that at this point.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“People change and they do leave, so it’s always possible that Tom will walk away, but it’s very slim and she&nbsp;knows it,” our insider explained. “It&nbsp;breaks Katie’s heart that&nbsp;Suri&nbsp;doesn’t have a relationship with Tom, there’s a&nbsp;definite hole in her life because of it — he is missed. Katie is such a daddy’s girl herself, she can’t imagine a life without a close relationship with her dad. But&nbsp;unfortunately that’s the reality for&nbsp;Suri.” As a result of Tom’s absence, Katie has had to majorly stepped up as a parent — and it has not been easy. At the same time though, Katie doesn’t regret the sacrifices she’s made for her little girl. And now that she’s dating Jamie, who’s a family man, things are finally starting to get a little easier.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“Katie’s tried so hard to be all things to&nbsp;Suri, there’s a definite hole there left by Tom, and Katie does her best to fill it,” the source added. “She’s grateful to have Jamie in her&nbsp;life now, he’s&nbsp;becoming more and more of a&nbsp;father figure to Suri&nbsp;and she’s very grateful for&nbsp;that.” As <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> has previously reported, Jamie and Suri get along great, and she enjoys having him in her life just as much as Katie does!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Tell us, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong> — are you shocked Tom and Suri still have no relationship? Do you think he’ll ever come back into her life?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH1ze49qZq2nnWKws8HIrJxmnJ%2BawK%2FAjKycnmWjqr%2Bqec2oZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF2frq61xGadqLCoYrOiwMeeqWaemZzCs7GO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
