At the start of the May 2 episode of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pretty Little Liars</a>, she had woken up from her coma and managed to say a few words. Toby was super happy — so much so, in fact, that he and Yvonne got married right then and there in her hospital room. But later, when they were talking about where they’d honeymoon, she totally croaked. The bouquet she was holding fell to the floor and Toby fell into Spencer’s arms. (Boy, he moves fast.)</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h3>Click here to see more pics from Season 7 of ‘Pretty Little Liars’!</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>But anyway, let’s get back to Hanna. Her budding fashion career took a hit when a blog accused her of stealing a design. Hanna was sure Jenna was behind it, but Aria and Emily later discovered that Sydney may have had something to do with it. So they tracked her down and found out she was making a large monetary deposit for Jenna to get her vision fixed. And the money was coming from an “anonymous donor (A.D.)”.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>We never found out who was behind the nasty blog post, but A.D. wanted Hanna to blow a meeting with investors as part of her turn in the game. However, once she discovered Caleb was in the hospital, she bailed on the meeting and lost out on winning another puzzle piece from&nbsp;A.D.’s game.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Aria was also still struggling with her Ezra situation&nbsp;— he was totally MIA this week, and Aria kept seeing Nicole on the news, so that didn’t help. But things got even worse when Aria returned home to Ezra’s apartment&nbsp;and found Nicole sitting alone in the dark. So what did Aria&nbsp;do? She grabbed a knife, of course! Okay, okay — she thought Nicole was an intruder, but still — you know Aria wishes she could get rid of Nicole once and for all. (Be gone, girl — Ezria forever!)</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what did YOU think of this week’s episode of Pretty Little Liars?
