Concert Shooting —&nbsp;PICS</h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>Zonnique faces a misdemeanor charge for carrying a weapon at a commercial service airport without a permit. She has yet to make a statement about the incident via social media. T.I. and Tiny also have yet to comment either, but this news likely comes as unsettling to them. The pair, who married in July 2010, have three children together, their two boys&nbsp;<strong>Clifford ‘King’ Joseph Harris III</strong>, 12, and <strong>Major Philant Harris</strong>, 8. They also&nbsp;welcomed their daughter <strong>Heiress Diana Harris</strong> to the world on March 26.&nbsp;T.I. has three other children from previous relationships, daughter&nbsp;<strong>Deyjah Imani Harris</strong>, 15,&nbsp;and two older sons, <strong>Domani Uriah Harris,&nbsp;</strong>15,&nbsp;and <strong>Messiah Ya’Majesty Harris</strong>, 14.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>[jwplatform j6TBbOxO]</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Zonnique’s arrest involving a gun may be especially heart-wrenching for T.I.&nbsp;in particular, due to the tragic shooting that occurred at his Irving Park concert in New York on May 25. One man was murdered&nbsp;and three others were also hurt as the audience fled for their lives before the rapper hit the stage. T.I. posted to his Instagram,&nbsp;“My heart is heavy today. Our music is intended to save lives, like mine and many others. My heartfelt condolences to the family that suffered the loss and my prayers are with those injured. Respectfully, Tip.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do you think of Zonnique’s arrest?
