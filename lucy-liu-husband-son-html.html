Thousands of people warmly congratulated and blessed her in the&nbsp;comment section.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In an interview with&nbsp;People magazine, months after little Rockwell was born, Liu revealed that gestational surrogacy seemed like the best option. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As she was busy with her professional commitments and didn’t know when she would stop, she opted for the surrogacy route to have a child.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>&nbsp;It just seemed like the right option for me because I was working and I didn't know when I was going to be able to stop.</p><p>Although the actress had to take a non-traditional approach to&nbsp;experience motherhood, she always knew that she was destined to be a mother.&nbsp;</p><p>However, some people had opinions regarding her way of having a baby, but Liu believed in how she carried herself from the point of having her son and loving him.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>I’m a single mother who had a baby through a gestational carrier, and I know that people had opinions about how it was done.</p><p>In&nbsp;an interview&nbsp;with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Yahoo Celebrities </a>in 2016, the mother-of-one revealed how people were judgemental on social media.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She also said that she finds it odd how people would have a negative slant on someone having a family, even in this time and age.</p><p>How can anyone have any discouraging words for a baby?&nbsp;I find that really shocking, and I felt it was strange and odd in this day and age that people would have a negative slant on someone having a family or having a judgment on how someone had a family.</p><h2>Motherhood Changed Lucy Liu’s Life In a Positive Way</h2><p>In another <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2020 interview</a> with Yahoo Celebrities, the&nbsp;Elementary&nbsp;actress opened up about how being a mother turned her life&nbsp;upside down&nbsp;in the best way possible. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She explained how one cannot address the changes particularly, but it’s more of an ‘overhaul.’</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>As a parent, Liu believes in finding a&nbsp;perfect balance&nbsp;between guiding her son, Rockwell, to the right path and allowing him to make decisions independently. Moreover, she revealed she felt like her priorities changed after becoming a mother.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>That human is yours to nurture, yours to love, and yours to teach - but you have to allow them to have independence as well.</p><p>Being a career-driven and independent woman, the 53-year-old actress&nbsp;opened up about how her dedication to her work hadn't&nbsp;changed at all.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, she&nbsp;insisted&nbsp;on loving her work even more because Rockwell made everything brighter. Liu added her child put everything in her life into perspective. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After having my son, it's not that I enjoy my job less, I love it much more because he makes everything in my life that much more. He helps underline everything in my life and put it all in bold.</p><h2>Lucy Liu’s Inspiration behind Motherhood</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>When asked about what inspired her to become a mother in her late 40s, she replied she had been visiting several nations with UNICEF to meet beautiful and warm children worldwide and felt something special about them.</p><p></p><p><strong>Liu celebrating her son Rockwell Lloyd's fifth birthday in August 2020.&nbsp;</strong>(Photo:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The purity of heart and the love the children share in a matter of moments are beautiful, she revealed.</p><p>I have to say, there is something incredibly special about children. There is an openness and sharing and love they give to you in a matter of seconds. That is something that you start to lose, as you get older, for whatever reason.</p><p>She further explained how she was passionate and devoted to her work, and&nbsp;it never occurred to her&nbsp;that time was flying by until one of her friends remarked about it. In fact, it was Liu's friend who suggested the surrogacy option.</p><p>As of now, Rockwell is six years old. The proud mother celebrated his 5th birthday with her social media followers, sharing an&nbsp;adorable picture&nbsp;in August 2020. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She wrote Rockwell is the rainbow of light in her life, and his energy is pure magic.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Does&nbsp;Lucy Liu Have a Husband?</h2><p>Probably because Liu already has a son, her fans and followers can't help but wonder if she is married. Interestingly, Liu remains unmarried.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, no information about her dating life or her current boyfriend has surfaced. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>That being said, Liu has been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">romantically linked</a> with few men. And <a href=# rel=follow>George Clooney</a> is one of her ex boyfriends, besides billionaire&nbsp;Noam&nbsp;Gottesman and&nbsp;Will McCormack.</p><p>She was also engaged to&nbsp;writer/director Zach Helm. But their <a href=# rel=follow>engagement ended</a> long before they could get married.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6HCpMWMpaCuZZiqwKOtzZ1krKeeY7W1ucs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
