But he knows that he has a lot of fans who are rooting for him and his family.</p><p>So, this week, Jorge offered his followers a picturesque little update.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jorge Nava shared not one but two photos of himself with his wife, Rhoda.</p><p>One showed only the two of them on a West Coast beach. The other showed them with their children, Zara and George.</p><p>“A picture is worth a thousand words,” Jorge captioned his post, “but the memories with my family are priceless.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Was his caption a little trite? Of course.</p><p>But Jorge has his freedom, a modicum of fame, a beautiful wife, and two precious children.</p><p>The guy is winning at life. He doesn’t need to reinvent the wheel when penning an Instagram caption. C’mon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Jorge and Rhoda welcomed young Zara first, and more recently baby George.</p><p>The couple have now been together for more than two years.</p><p>Considering that, just three years ago, Jorge was still married to Anfisa Arkhipchenko Nava and also behind bars, they have come a long way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In 2018, Jorge’s entire life turned upside down.</p><p>While transporting marijuana, which is legal in many states including his home of California, Jorge experienced a police search in Arizona.</p><p>Arizona at the time had some of the nation’s strictest marijuana laws. He received a 2.5 year prison sentence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Jorge and Anfisa resolved to remain married even as he began serving his sentence.</p><p>He reported to prison. Anfisa continued her education and began competing for a bodybuilding competition.</p><p>But she was not the only one who underwent a body transformation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Jorge underwent a dramatic weight loss journey, showing off the results in his updated prison photos in late 2019.</p><p>Many 90 Day Fiance fans congratulated him, albeit not in a way that he was likely to see. Others swooned over him.</p><p>There was one person who, by Jorge’s own account, had a very different reaction to all of this attention.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>According to Jorge, Anfisa suddenly stopped contacting him — her incarcerated husband — around that time.</p><p>Months later, he found out the same way as everyone else that she was dating a new man.</p><p>That is to say that she went Instagram official with a guy. That’s how it got back to Jorge that his wife was no longer truly his wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Then, in May of 2020, Jorge finally got to leave prison and enjoy his freedom.</p><p>That unjust arrest and sentence robbed him of a lot of life experiences, and ejected him into a world under siege by COVID-19.</p><p>But he was out. He was free. And he was ready for something new.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Obviously, getting to make his own choices and enjoy freedom were Jorge’s first priorities.</p><p>But soon, he revealed, he was going on dates with an unnamed woman.</p><p>For the longest time, all that fans knew was that she was hot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Two and a half years ago, Jorge walked out of prison for the last time.</p><p>Now, he has a wife and two children.</p><p>We are glad that he is willing to share these heartwarming life updates with us all.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2Z9cLbOq56eZZ6Ww6J50qGYq52jYr%2BivsRmnZqlmaHGbrzHqKuoZZaarrXB0aKloGWnnrOmedOwpmabmJ65pb7Ep2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
