Rocking what appears to be a makeup-free face, the star dons a white tank top on the magazine cover with her pink bra strap peaking out. Her hair’s styled slicked back in a sophisticated low bun and she donned an eye-catching pair of chunky gold hoop earrings.
“Photographed by her family,” it says on the cover to the left of Keys’ portrait."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The NYC native’s husband,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong> Swizz Beatz</strong></a>, assisted the little ones on set.</p><p>But apparently a good chunk of the photography credit goes to Egypt and Beatz. According to the outlet, Genesis wasn’t too thrilled with his equipment. “He was like, ‘I want the smaller camera!'” Keys <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told InStyle</a>.</p><p>The mastermind behind Keys’ outfits was celebrity fashion stylist Jason Bolden. He helped her choose a variety of fabulous summer ensembles, including a pale blue jumpsuit from the Givenchy and a flowy orange Fendi maxi dress.</p><p>Keys’ children aren’t the only kids who’ve photographed their parents for a national magazine during the COVID-19 quarantine. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Drew Barrymore’s</strong></a> daughter, Olive, shot mom’s cover for T<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he Sunday Times Style</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> magazine</a> at the beach in April of 2020.</p><p>“The following is a dialogue between me and my daughter,” the actress captioned an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a> on April 19. “ME: Olive will you take pictures for the @thesstyle photoshoot. Its for a magazine people work for years to shoot for! OLIVE: Why are you asking me to shoot you, Mom? And who normally shoots you?”</p><p>She continued, “ME: A photographer. But right now, the world is in a crazy place. Everything is an opportunity to do things differently! So what do you say? Do you want to be my photographer? OLIVE: I’m honored to be your photographer. I like taking pictures, so thank you.”</p><p>Like Egypt and Genesis, Olive did a great job photographing her mom. Who knows, maybe these celebs bred the next big fashion photographers of the future.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5a5qq%2FImmSknamoeqS0yKWbq52eYr2pu9OonquZoJ2ypXnHnqlmoqWhxm61zayrsqSVYrCwwsSrZKmhk2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
