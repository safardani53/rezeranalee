Jennifer Hudson’s 3-year-old son David Jr. (with fiance David Otunga) is equally fashion-forward, the American Idol alum reveals, offering his mother totally unsolicited fashion advice.
“We call him Boss Baby!” Hudson tells Lucky mag‘s January issue (on stands December 11.) “He says, ‘Mommy, I don’t like that,’ or ‘Momma, you look very pretty.'”
