Jameela Jamil showed off her “boob stretch marks” in an Instagram selfie as she feuded with the Kardashians over the weight loss products they promote.
“Boob stretch marks are a normal, beautiful thing,” Jamil, 33, wrote on Instagram on Monday, April 1, captioning the pic. “I have stretch marks all over my body and I hereby rename them all Babe Marks. They are a sign my body dared to take up extra space in a society that demands our eternal thinness."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They are a sign my body dared to take up extra space in a society that demands our eternal thinness. They are my badge of honour for resisting society’s weaponizing of the female form.”</p><p>The Good Place actress also clarified why her complexion looked paler than usual in the photo. “My face is white because I wear spf 100 sunscreen like a boss,” she wrote. “PS. LOVE YOUR BROWN SKIN. I tan responsibly but I love to tan! I love to embrace and celebrate my heritage. This skin bleaching and whitening should be banned. It’s inherently racist, classist and emotionally very damaging. #brownandproud.”</p><p>Earlier that day, Jamil called out the Kardashians’ response to her criticisms of the family. She had previously called <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> a “terrible and toxic influence on young girls” for appearing in a Flat Tummy Co ad and declared that <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> had been <a href=#>“fat shamed … into a prison of self-critique”</a> after the 34-year-old made a general statement about girls wanting to lose weight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Jameela-Jamil-Spotlights-Boob-Stretch-Marks-Amid-Kardashian-Feud-01.jpg><p>Kim, 38, defended herself against the backlash in <a href=#>a New York Times article</a> posted last week, saying the product promotion is “work that is really easy that doesn’t take away from our kids.” <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a>, meanwhile, told the Times that she “[doesn’t] live in that negative energy space” and that “ninety percent of people will be really excited about the family and the journey and who we are.”</p><p>On Monday, Jamil rejected the Kardashians’ comments: “Essentially, ‘f–k the young, impressionable people, or those struggling with eating disorders, we want the money,’” she <a href=#>tweeted</a>. “I have been given these same opportunities to flog this stuff, and I don’t do it, so they don’t have to. Thank you, next.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In <a href=#>a follow-up post</a>, the British model said the Kardashians’ pockets “are lined with the blood and diarrhea of teenage girls.”</p><p>Last week, Jamil told Us Weekly she <a href=#>wasn’t trying to “cancel” the Kardashians</a> or other celebrities or influencers who promote weight loss products. “I just want them to start being more responsible and to start looking out for the mental health of young people,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGajmZ2asq2tjKOYpqGcYsCpu9asZJunn5d6tMDRnqucoF2irrO30maYpqGUYriivsOaqqGhkaN6p7HUnWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
