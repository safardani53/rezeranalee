She really is,” Jelly said of Bunnie to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Music Mayhem Magazine</a>. “She’s supported me. She helped me get my music career really up and going.” Let’s take a look at the woman, the myth, the legend… Bunnie XO, below!</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Bunnie loves getting to know the most genuine version of the people she brings onto her podcasts. In an April 27 Instagram post, in which she lounged on a beanbag chair in nothing by a skimpy bodysuit (seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>), she spoke about her interest in unraveling people’s layers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“I love unmade beds, I love when people are crying & cannot be anything but honest in that moment. I love the look in people’s eyes when they realize they are in love,” she penned.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>“I love the way people look when they first wake up & they’ve forgotten their surroundings. I love the gasp people take when their favorite character dies. I love when people close their eyes & drift somewhere in the clouds. I fall in love with honest moments all the time. I fall in love with their breakdowns & their smeared makeup & their daydreams. Honesty is just too beautiful to ever put into words,” she concluded.</p><h2>How Did Jelly Roll & Bunnie XO Meet?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Jelly Roll married Bunnie, real name <strong>Bunnie DeFord</strong>, in Aug. 2016 after reportedly first meeting at one of his shows in Las Vegas, NV., according to<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;Music Mayhem</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>“We hit it off,” Jelly Roll said, adding, “She said she fell in love with the saddest eyes in the room.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>The meet-cute was electric, to say the least, according to the rapper. “I felt her soul,” he continued. “When I hugged her, I could just feel the genuineness of her. I could tell it wasn’t an act.”</p><h2>Jelly Roll & Bunnie XO’s Relationship</h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>The couple are really cute together and even their “weirdness” works with each other! Bunnie shared a sweet clip of the pair sitting together at a table at a wedding and they immediately begin vibing off each other. Check out the clip, captioned, “Find someone who matches your weird,” above!</p><h2>Does Jelly Roll Have Kids?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-21>Jelly was a father of two before his path collided with Bunnie. A previous relationship resulted in a son named&nbsp;<strong>Noah Buddy DeFord</strong>, who was born in 2016, and a different romance resulted in his daughter <strong>Bailee Ann DeFord</strong> being welcomed in May 2008.</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>“[Bunnie] helped me raise my&nbsp;daughter,” Jelly Roll told Music Mayhem. “We’ve had custody of her for the last nine years. It just takes a real selfless person to help raise a child they didn’t birth.” The outlet reported Bunnie is also stepmother to Noah.</p><h2>Jelly Roll is Crazy About His Wife.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-23>In a July post, Jelly Roll made no secret of his high regard for his wife. “A BUNNIE APPRECIATION POST!” he captioned a pic of the couple snuggling up backstage, with Bunnie rocking a fierce cutout bodysuit.&nbsp; “A lot is often said or made about my story, but the truth is I’ve never been moved more by a story than the story of my wife. To watch what this woman has overcome and her passion and determination to be something better has inspired me from the moment I met her.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-26>He continued, in part, gushing, “She saved me in one of the darkest times of my life. She has been nothing but supportive. I remember her sitting at our kitchen table and her talking to me about the vision she had to start the ‘Dumb Blonde’ Podcast, and how it was her means to end working in the sex industry for good. I watched her build her own platform, her own podcast, and her own team with ZERO help from me. She wanted to do it on her own — she didn’t want to be just ‘Jelly Roll’s wife’ — she wanted to build her own empire to empower women and share her story in hopes that it could motivate others to believe that they could change their lives and be happy.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-27>He added that she’d be on tour with him, hosting her very own Meet and Greets with fans.</p><h2>Jelly Roll Called One of Bunnie’s Exes ‘Abusive’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-30>“She was with some abusive douchebag, and they came to a show, and we were backstage,” Jelly Roll said of first meeting Bunnie during an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>King and the Sting and the Wing Clips</a>. “They split, and I’m not going to act like I shot my shot. She kind of shot hers. We had mutual friends. She said, ‘Yo. Just plug me in with Jelly.'” And the rest is herstory!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8meo6WxXae8rbiMsKCfnV1qfXeAmGlvaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
