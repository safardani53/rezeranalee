Jessa Duggar is shutting down speculation that she missed sister Jill Duggar’s baby shower due to a brewing feud — insisting it was simply a logistical issue. 
The rumors began after their cousin, Amy Duggar, hosted a baby shower for Jill, 31, and shared photos from the event via Instagram on Thursday, July 7. 
“It was so fun celebrating this new life!” Jessa, 29, commented, which prompted fans to question why the 19 Kids and Counting star wasn’t in any of the snaps despite being in attendance, even doubting any of the Duggar siblings were present for the bash."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The narrative these kinds of comments put forward is a false one. Simply not true.”</p><p class=x_x_p1>Jessa went on to <a href=#>confirm she was present</a> at the shower, noting that “pretty much everyone else was out of town” due to their hectic summer plans and that “you cannot always coordinate 19+ schedules.”</p><p class=x_x_p1>“We spend plenty of time together even if there aren’t photos circulating on the internet to prove it. … Not every gathering has to be a photo op,” she argued, before concluding the lengthy post with a plea to “quit spreading hate.”</p><p class=x_x_p1>Amy, 35, later came <a href=#>to her cousin’s defense</a>, confirming that “we had a beautiful turnout and enjoyed just being in the moment!”</p><p class=x_x_p1>“There wasn’t any drama<a href=#> and Jill was glowing</a>!” the Maryland native wrote on Wednesday.<span class=x_x_Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=x_x_p1>This isn’t the first time Jessa has stuck up for her family on social media.

We’re<a href=#> not on the best terms</a> with some of my family,” she explained at the time. “We’ve had some disagreements, but we’re working toward healing definitely and restoration, but we’re having to kind of just take some time and heal.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=x_x_p1>Jessa’s clap backs come in the midst of her brother <a href=#><strong>Josh Duggar’s</strong></a> child pornography conviction. The Arkansas native was convicted of two counts of receiving and possessing child pornography in December 2021, and was sentenced to 151 months in prison on May 25, which translates to roughly 12.5 years.
