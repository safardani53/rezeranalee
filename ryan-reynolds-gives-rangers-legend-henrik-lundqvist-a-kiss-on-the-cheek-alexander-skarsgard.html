Reynolds joined New York Rangers legend Henrik Lundqvist and fellow Swede Alexander Skarsgård at Madison Square Garden in New York City to watch the Rangers take on the Minnesota Wild, whom they beat 4-3 following a three-on-three overtime and a shootout. The Deadpool actor's excitement to be sitting with Lundqvist was palpable. The former goaltender, 40, is an icon at the Garden — one of just 11 players to have their jersey number retired, following an impressive 15-season run with the team — and he holds the record for most wins by a European-born goaltender in the NHL."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He grabbed Lundqvist by the chin as the jumbotron flitted to their star-studded row of seats and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>planted a big one on him</a> as Skarsgård, 46, hilariously pretended to snooze on Lundqvist's opposite shoulder.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The smooch quickly made rounds on social media, but it wasn't the first for Lundqvist that evening. In fact, Reynolds stole the move from Skarsgård, who <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>planted a kiss on the former player's cheek</a> earlier in the night — a move that was also caught on the jumbotron, to fans' delight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For Lundqvist, returning to the Garden was potentially a nostalgic moment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Swedish-born player, who was awarded the Golden Puck and Golden Helmet for his career in Sweden before coming to the Rangers, retired from the sport in 2021 following <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>a diagnosis of a heart condition</a> that he shared made "the risk of playing before remedying my condition too high."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>underwent open-heart surgery</a> a month after announcing the diagnosis and, seven months later, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>announced his retirement</a> from the league.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I came to the conclusion that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>there are too many unknowns</a> and too much risk for not enough reward for me to keep playing," he told the New York Post at the time.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Henrik Lundqvist and Ryan Reynolds.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>NY Rangers/MSG Sports</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1><strong>RELATED GALLERY:</strong> 28 Celebs Who Have Gotten Starstruck by Meeting Their Favorite Celebs</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've always been at peace with it," he told PEOPLE in January 2022 of his jersey retirement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It was a tear-filled occasion, both for Lundqvist himself and his 100 loved ones in the crowd — 60 of whom had flown in from Sweden for the event.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>I look back at my 15 years here</a>, what gives me the most satisfaction is not the wins or the personal recognition," he said during his speech.
