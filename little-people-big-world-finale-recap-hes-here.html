I’ll be by you,” Zach told his wife, offering assurance, only for her to change the topic slightly.Will&nbsp;</p><p>Will Zach be okay?!?</p><p>"Are you going to look? Don’t look,” she said, pointing down at her belly. “I would suggest don’t look. I don’t care if you look down at the incision, but from what I’ve heard, I would suggest don’t look."</p><p>What? Why not? Zack asked.</p><p>They literally take your intestines out and put them on the table, Tori replied.</p><p>After originally making this face in response…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/zach-roloff-in-scrubs-1024x908.png><p>… Zach tried to put a positive spin on the experience.</p><p>"That’s like a bucket list kind of thing,” he reasoned. “When will I ever be able to see someone’s intestines?"</p><p>That’s a fair question, we suppose. And a good way to look at the situation.</p><p>Later on, the Roloffs discussed the possibility of their son being born with achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism.</p><p>(We now know, of course, that <a href=#>Jackson does have this gene</a>, just like his father.)</p><p>“It was always a scary thought to have an achon baby,” Tori confessed, adding:</p><p>“I went to the dwarf games with you and saw one kid in particular who had a [trachestomy].</p><p>It terrified me because there was a moment when we were on the field that he stopped breathing and his mom was so on it, she literally didn’t flinch."</p><p>Tori wondered whether she’d be able to gather this sort of strength and confidence when it came to the condition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/zach-and-tori-998x1024.png><p>Elsewhere, as they awaited their grandson’s arrival, Amy and Matt decided to put all differences aside and just focus on the fun times they had raising four kids on their farm.</p><p>Won’t it be amazing to repeat this experience with another child?</p><p>At last, the day arrived.</p><p>With the C-sections scheduled, there was no panic over water-breaking nor any major surprises with labor, just a few nerves on the part of the first-time-parents-to-be.</p><p>“The next time I see you, you’re gonna be mom and dad,” Amy told Tori and Zach at the hospital as the former was wheeled inside the delivery room.</p><p>At exactly 8 a.m. that day, little Jackson was born, but he wasn’t so little at the time, weighing in at nine pounds and one ounce.</p><p>“I think he’s gonna be an easy one to love,” Zach said upon first holding him.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Jackson Roloff Baby Photos: OMG! He’s So Cute!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>Uncle Jeremy and Aunt Audrey later arrived, while Amy summed up the miraculous event and the new member of her famous family as follows:</p><p>"It was really nice that we all came together to say, ‘Zach and Tori, your baby’s loved already. It was loved before it was born, it’s loved right now, it’s going to continue being loved.’"</p><p>And, with that, Season 13 comes to an end.</p><p>But Amy has already confirmed to viewers that <a href=#>Season 14 is on the way</a>, with a premiere date in September and with another precious bundle of joy on the way:</p><p>Indeed, Audrey and Jeremy will be welcoming a baby girl this fall!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WDcLjIraulnV2lsrC8y55km6GXYsSwvsudZJ%2Bhnpa5pnnRnpqaqF2dsrR5x56pnmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
