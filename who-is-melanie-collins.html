It's important, she said, to "always be the most prepared person in the room," and "say yes to anything that will get you experience."</p><p>The industry is always changing and moving in different directions and she advised to "be open-minded" about the role or the title you take on.</p><p>"Don't have your career path set in stone," she said. "I promise it won't work out the way you think! But most of the time it works out better."</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH54gJBvZ21wX6y1sHnIrGSmnZyWu6qxjJympaSZo8Bw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
