He goes to his side–"</p><p>Ryan cut her off to ask: “Of the house?”</p><p>“Not of the house but of the bed,” she explained. “And I go to my side of the bed.”&nbsp;</p><p>The 51-year-old continued: “We don’t share a duvet or a comforter because it’s just large enough and we are small people, so we just go to our separate corners and there’s room.”</p><p>Her co-host wanted some more details on the matter and asked: “Is he not a cuddler?”</p><p>She shared: “We do not cuddle.&nbsp;</p><p>“Like, we are romantic, and we have adult sexy time and then when it’s over, we do not touch each other.”</p><p>Demonstrating what they do next, she pat Ryan on his hand and said: “Once in a while, it’s like, ‘That was fun.’ ‘Yes, it was.’”</p><p>“Just when I think I know everything about you,” he said, laughing about it all.</p><h2>WHAT A BOOB</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/image-260.png><p>Just days earlier, Kelly shared another&nbsp;<a href=#>NSFW comment about herself</a>, this time while admitting she doesn't know how she was able to nab her husband Mark.</p><p>She and Ryan&nbsp;were in the middle of talking about Father’s Day when Kelly got personal.</p><p>A confused Kelly began: “To marry a romantic who likes putting things together and fixing things?&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m just a girl from New Jersey with minimal skill sets with everything.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m not particularly good. I have no gifts, I’m not talented.”</p><p>The talk show host, 51, didn’t stop there, though.</p><p>She added: “I don’t have big boobs. I have nothing to offer!”&nbsp;</p><p>Ryan had been listening calmly, but this comment shocked him and had him awkwardly laughing and having to put his head down on his desk.</p><p>After lifting it back up, he seemed uncomfortable as he shuffled random papers in front of him that he wasn’t even using.</p><h2>FEELING NIPPY</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/image-279.png><p>During one Live show, Ryan had a little trouble with some <a href=#>chest pasties he was wearing</a> at request of producers, who wanted to make sure no one would feel uncomfortable with anything showing through his thin shirt.&nbsp;</p><p>At one point, he was reminiscing about one of his first cars, when he started to feel his chest through his shirt to check on the pasties.</p><p>Kelly, though, didn’t know exactly what he was doing and joked about his car making him “aroused.”</p><p>After Ryan explained what happened, she just continued and said that he was “freakier than [she] imagined.”</p><h2>UNDER WHERE?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/image-235.png><p>Ryan and his undergarments were the victims of another NSFW moment, when the hosts had on lifestyle expert Monica Mangin.</p><p>Both Monica and&nbsp;<a href=#>Kelly wore polka dot dresses</a>, while Ryan had on a simple solid suit.</p><p>“I feel left out,” an upset Ryan told the women. “I didn’t get the pattern email!”</p><p>That’s when&nbsp;Kelly&nbsp;quipped back with a NSFW joke about his undergarments.</p><p>Pretending to share a real, embarrassing secret about him, she said: “But [executive producer Michael] Gelman told me you’re wearing polka dot panties!”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>He then angrily shot back to someone off-camera: “That was between us!”</p><p>A man, presumably Michael, could be heard yelling back: “Sorry!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2htaWx%2Fc4OUaKOirpViwLWt0WainqScrnqztc%2BaZKano6l6r7%2FFsGSmp52au7W%2FjKuwmqZdqLKir9Geqq1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
