<a href=#>social media </a>platform to share: “Lots of messages about the hurricane so far we are all ok but keeping a close eye on the <a href=#>news</a> for updates,” followed by a praying hands emoji.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, it appears the <a href=#>family </a>are not too bothered at all as they’ve even gone to enjoy a day out at Magic Kingdom Park, which is a Walt <a href=#>Disney</a> World Resort.&nbsp;</p><p>Sharing scenes from their time at the <a href=#>theme park</a>, she posted a clip of the area by a lake, where viewers could see some dark clouds overhead.&nbsp;</p><p>“So excited for Magic Kingdom,” she wrote over this as they approached the park on a ferry.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="read more fabulous stories">read more fabulous stories</h2><p>She then posted a photo of her wrist, which had a band that said “not so scary <a href=#>Halloween </a>Party”.&nbsp;</p><p>Posting a series of photos from the park, viewers could see that the place had been decked out with autumnal decorations.&nbsp;</p><p>The park even has lamp posts with orange pumpkin-shaped <a href=#>Mickey Mouse</a> sculptures alongside orange, red and yellow leaves in a wreath around them.&nbsp;</p><p>She then reshared a photo of her kids all posing with wide smiles plastered across their faces as they stood in front of a large castle.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>In another scene, the family visited an indoor installation where there were neon platforms with dolls on them.&nbsp;</p><p>Sue also couldn’t help but post a sweet photo of her child looking over the moon with the trip to Magic Kingdom.&nbsp;</p><p>“The face of pure joy,” she wrote over this with a smiling emoji.&nbsp;</p><p>She then showed off an incredible toy they picked up, which was designed in the theme of The Nightmare Before <a href=#>Christmas</a>.</p><p>The Mayor from the <a href=#>film</a> could be seen <a href=#>driving</a> a toy car while Shock appeared in the back seat and Lock poked his head out the side.&nbsp;</p><p>And, clearly having a grand time, another clip showed her kids dancing and having fun as they collected what appeared to be sweets off the ground and placed them into their bags.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn’t the first theme park they’ve visited since arriving in the US as they’ve also gone to <a href=#>Universal Studios</a> and enjoyed the waterslides.&nbsp;</p><p>And though they seem to be loving every moment of their 18th holiday in just 20 months, it hasn’t all been plain sailing.&nbsp;</p><p>Just days ago, the family had to rush to the emergency room for the second time as Sue told her followers: “Second time here in a few days.</p><p>“First Daisy with a nasty ear infection, now it’s Connor’s turn.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Sue</a> and<a href=#> Noel</a> are parents to Chris, 34, Sophie, 29,<a href=#> Chloe</a>, 28, Jack,
