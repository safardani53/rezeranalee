All these years, people think the joke has been on me, but it’s actually been on the public. I know exactly what I’m doing … I make more jokes about myself than anybody,” Parton told <a href=#><strong>Barbara Walters</strong></a> in <a href=#>1977</a>. “I’ve often made this statement that I would never stoop so low as to be fashionable, that’s the easiest thing in the world to do, so I just decided that I would do something that would at least get the attention.”</p><p>The “Jolene” singer added: “Once they got past the shock of the ridiculous way I looked and all that then they would see there was parts of me to be appreciated. I’m very real where it counts, and that’s inside.”</p><p>Parton, who is known for <a href=#>her big, blonde hair and even bigger boobs</a>, has sung about her looks for decades, including her 1967 hit, “Dumb Blonde.”</p><p>“I hope people see the brain underneath the wig and the heart beneath the boobs,” the <a href=#>Tennessee native</a> told <a href=#><strong>Al Roker</strong></a> in June 2003, noting she’s been wearing blonde wigs for years because her natural locks wouldn’t tease the right way. “Part of the magic is that I look so totally artificial, but I am so totally real.”</p><p>Underwood, for her part, spoke with <a href=#>CMT Insider</a> in November 2009 about being one of the many blonde beauties in country music rising to fame. When asked if she felt responsible for blondes having a bigger role in country, she responded, “I don’t know if I ever really thought about it that way because I think of people like Miranda who were around before I was. So you could say she started it all. It’s her fault.”</p><p>The <a href=#>“Before He Cheats” singer</a> added that “it’s all good” that the platinum hair color is dominated among women in the industry. “Us blondes have all got to stick together,” she concluded.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The <a href=#>Oklahoma songstress</a> also addressed <a href=#>how she felt about women’s rise in country</a>, saying, “I feel like before it was always this anomaly — woman one, singular — that would come in and really make her mark and do great. And now there’s more of us, and we’re all doing this. And so, I’m really happy with the way things are going. Hopefully, we can take over. I know it’s possible.”</p><p>Scroll down to see country music’s most beautiful blonde bombshells.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvCqKynrKKueq7B0qKarGWSobyvsMRmmailkqi1prjLrGRraGFngnd7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
