She says that she's been given medications but is unsatisfied with the level of care she's received.

A man recording the video says that he has had surgery done in the same center and that he commiserates with the woman's pain, "I know what she's going through and it's not fun," he tells the security guards. He then exclaims how shocked he was to see her treated by the doctor in that manner.</p><p>"My mind is blown," he says near the end of the second clip.</p><p>In a third video she demands that the doctor be arrested if he wants to call the police on her.
