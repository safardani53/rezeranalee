The how was very&nbsp;big. Kyle revealed that it was getting to her that her husband was always working and they barely got time to spend with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, they all went to lunch and Kim revealed that she did not want to talk about the fight at her games night. Kim said that she was proud of her sister’s sobriety.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere, Lisa Rinna met up with her friend, Eden Sassoon and they got talking about games night. Eden claimed that she felt "no connection" to Kyle at the game night.&nbsp;</p><p>Lisa R was shocked because she thought they would all be able to get along fine, but no one can ever really get along on this show. She also stated that Kyle would apologize to her in due course.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The pair then switched gears to talk about Kim’s sobriety. Eden said that she wanted to help Kim because she understood what was going on with her.&nbsp;</p><p>Lisa R then got a little bit too involved by branding Kyle as Kim’s "enabler." That’s a harsh thing to say and it will probably come back to haunt her.&nbsp;</p><p>Kyle then met up with both of them for lunch. Kyle was upset that Eden got straight to the point and quizzed her about other people in her family having addictions.&nbsp;</p><p>Kyle shut her down, but Eden continued saying that Kim’s energy was sad. This did not stop Eden, who felt the need to continue pursuing a reaction.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, Kyle made her way to Greece with Erika. However, Kyle was still upset about what had happened with Eden and struggled to enjoy herself.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The last straw came when Erika’s dancers threw her in the pool.</p><p>"I don’t want to be Debbie Downer," Kyle commented to the camera.</p><p>"But they just spent three hours getting her hair to look like that."</p><p>Finally, Dorit thought it would be a good idea to reach out to Eileen and Lisa R to find out how to fix the situation. Dorit admitted that she had drank way too much and should have kept her mouth shut.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>However, Dorit did point out that Eileen was the one who got on her nerves the most because she started the argument about Erika.&nbsp;</p><p>"I’m not speaking on behalf of her. I’m speaking on behalf of myself," Eileen clarified.</p><p>After some more back and forth, the ladies agreed to return to the way they once were and the feud was over.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think about all this drama?</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>19 Real Housewives Who Only Lasted One Season</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2V%2BcMDHnmSrnZGheqm71KycsKGmmsBuu8VmmZ6ulae5unnHoqOlq12osqK%2FzqdkcGWVpba0u8OeZHBlopqworyMoqto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
