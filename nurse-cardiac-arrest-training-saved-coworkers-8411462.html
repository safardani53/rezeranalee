You just don’t expect that to happen with someone as young as Andy,” the instructor told the AP.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hoang told the AP her family does not have any history of heart problems.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The recent nursing graduate also told the outlet she maintains a pretty “healthy” lifestyle — she runs, eats well and hits the gym four times a week.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I would say I’m your pretty average healthy 23-year-old,” she said. “I’m on my feet 12, 13 hours a day at work, so I want to make sure that I’m in shape for that.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Nurse Andy Hoang has returned to work since experiencing a cardiac arrest in November.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>AP Photo/Charles Krupa</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to her cardiac arrest in November, she had only ever passed out twice — once because her blood sugar was low and once after experiencing a sharp abdominal pain — “so nothing like this, nothing to this extent,” she told the AP.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During her recovery, she was given a patch that recorded data about her heart’s electrical activity, which doctors hope to learn from.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hoang, who has since returned to work, told the outlet she is thankful that the “life-or-death experience” strengthened her relationship with her coworkers. She feels like part of a family at the medical center, and considers the other nurses to be some of her best friends.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a>&nbsp;to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It really changed my perspective on how I view life,” she said of the experience. “Hug your family a little longer [and] tell them that you love them, because it might be the last time you get to say it to them.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“And just cherish life for what you’ve been given,” she added. “It’s precious, and I didn’t realize how precious it was until I nearly lost it.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ56qv7SxjJyYq5yZlrBurdGrnKysXam%2ForXNoqWgZaOWw6awjJymsKeioLKzv4xxa2ppZGt%2F</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
