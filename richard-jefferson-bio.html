His parents, Richard Jefferson Sr and Meekness LeCota, originate from the state.</p><p>He grew up in a normal household as a single child. Further, his parents raised him fully Christian and even made him join a Christian religious group.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to Jefferson’s parents being fully devoted to this group, they frequently used to move around. Therefore, he attended multiple schools throughout their journey.</p><p>However, finally, they settled in Phoenix, Arizona, for a long time, during which he graduated from Moon Valley High School.</p><p>By this time, young Richard had already picked up great skills in basketball. Hence, he helped the high school team win a state championship in his senior year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Richard-Jefferson-during-a-game.jpg><p>Seeing his great potential, the University of Arizona offered him a scholarship which Jefferson happily accepted. He was also a key player on the University’s men’s basketball team during his three years.</p><p>RJ started in 77 out of 84 collegiate games, where he performed exceptionally. Nevertheless, their efforts fell short in the 2001 national championship game to Duke.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, he decided to enter the NBA draft as his projection from NBA scouts was very high.</p><p>Besides that, the former NBA player is well characterized as a wise, responsible, and hard-working individual by his family and peers.</p><p>His teammates recognized him as a solid team player throughout his seventeen-year basketball career.</p><h2>Richard Jefferson | Age, Height, and Weight&nbsp;</h2><p>The one-time NBA champion was born on June 21, 1980, and is 43 years old as of 2023. As a former athlete, he still takes terrific care of his health and diet.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, Jefferson is in great shape despite not having to undergo intense training. He still frequently works out at the gym.</p><p>Furthermore, he weighs 233 lb (106 kg) and is 6 ft 7 in tall.&nbsp;</p><h2>Richard Jefferson | Basketball Career</h2><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>High School Career<br></span></h3><p>Jefferson played high school basketball in various schools because his family constantly moved. However, for his senior year, the Jefferson family settled in Arizona.</p><p>Hence, he played high school basketball for Moon Valley High School. He played the small forward position and wreaked havoc on the rim due to his height advantage.</p><p>Despite having a height advantage, Richard preferred to shoot rather than take it down the post. As a result, he developed good shooting skills that helped him through his career.</p><p>Further, RJ was the center of his high school basketball team’s offense. The&nbsp;former NBA player led his team to a state championship win in his senior year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>You might be interested in Warriors’ star player <strong>Klay Thompson Bio: Early Life, Girlfriend, Net Worth & Injury.</strong></a></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>College Career</span></h3><p>The basketball analyst’s skills were nourished after joining the University of Arizona. Despite being a rookie, he started the majority of the season games.</p><p>He always picked up the slack for his team in offense or defense. Richard was the best player on the court game after game.</p><p>Hence, the rookie quickly earned a spot in the permanent starting lineup for his sophomore year. Unfortunately, they were unable to reach the national championship finals.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Richard-Jefferson-at-Universit-of-Arizona-1024x679.jpeg><p>This quickly changed in Jefferson’s junior year as they not only went to the finals but were favored to win the tournament.&nbsp;</p><p>To their surprise, Duke Blue Devils’ opponents were not going down without a fight. No team ever built a strong momentum through the game as the Blue Devils.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the Devils prevailed and gave Richard’s team a loss they will always remember in the end. Regardless of their loss, Jefferson was widely praised for his outstanding performance.</p><p>As a result, he decided not to finish college and instead entered the 2001 NBA draft.</p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>NBA Career</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jefferson entered the NBA draft in 2001 as a junior out of college. Further, the New Jersey Net picked him as the first-round 13th overall pick.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Initially, he didn’t get much playtime as a rookie. However, this quickly changed in his second season as he started raining Fire, as his offensive game was very well crafted.</p><p>Season by season, Richard was turning into a bucket machine. Nevertheless, the Nets as a team were very dysfunctional. Even though they made the playoffs, the Nets were always eliminated early.</p><p>Hence, the Nets decided to trade RJ to the Bucks after seven seasons. This was a very unusual trade because Jefferson was just coming off his career-high average in points, which was 22.6 points per game.</p><p>The Bucks were not a fit for him. That’s why they let him walk in free agency. Richard joined the Spurs and was productive for the team.</p><p>Nonetheless, that also didn’t work out in three years. As a result, Jefferson went to the Warriors, the Jazz, and the Mavericks for one season each.</p><p>After moving from team to team, the player found a home in Cavaliers. During this time, he formed a very brotherly bond with <a href=# rel=noopener>LeBron</a>, which can still be seen in the media.</p><p>Furthermore, in his first season with the Cavs, he won his first historical NBA championship. Due to his excellent support in winning the title, the Cavs extended his deal by one year.</p><p>This could have been his changing point, but it was clear that the age factor was playing its role. Therefore, he was traded to the Nuggets, which was his final NBA season.</p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Post Basketball and Analyst Career<br></span></h3><p>Following the 2017-18 season with the Denver Nuggets, Jefferson announced his retirement on October 13, 2018.</p><p>Shortly after that, he joined YES Network to start his broadcasting career.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Analyst-Richard-Jefferson.jpg><p>At YES Network, he became the Nets’ game and studio analyst.

Not to mention, Lourenco was a former model that was relatively successful during her prime.</p><p>She was awarded the “Best New Face” and the “Best New Generation Model” awards at a beauty pageant. Following her success, Lourenco pursued a modeling career.</p><p>Therefore, she began modeling for multiple private agencies.

Hence, they started dating one another, which led to a serious relationship.</p><p>Nevertheless, they always preferred to keep their life out of the media’s limelight while dating. Hence, there are very few pictures of them on the internet.</p><p>Besides that, the pair didn’t have any kids. Nevertheless, Lourenco had two kids from her previous relationship, and Jefferson had a son.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, the basketballer’s relationship status remains unknown, and he barely talks about it in the media.&nbsp;</p><h3>Richard Jefferson Calling Off the Wedding at the Very Last Moment</h3><p>The ESPN analyst was very committed to Kesha Ni’Cole Nichols from the start of his NBA career.</p><p>They were very vocal about their relationship, as they frequently admired each other in the media. Therefore, when the news of Richard marrying former Nets dancer Kesha spread, everyone took it seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, some people made a huge mess about his news as it was a bit unethical for a Nets player to date a Nets dancer.</p><p>Hence, the media stretched this topic as wide as they could by running it repeatedly. Nevertheless, these media stories didn’t seem to affect the couple as they confirmed the news of their marriage.</p><p>As a result, everything was set. The bride and the guest had already arrived at the altar. However, Jefferson got cold feet and called off the wedding.&nbsp;</p><p>He called his friend two hours before the wedding and said he wouldn’t come. The news was a great shock and tragedy for everyone attending the wedding.</p><p>Not to mention, the wedding that never took place cost the NBA player $2 million.
