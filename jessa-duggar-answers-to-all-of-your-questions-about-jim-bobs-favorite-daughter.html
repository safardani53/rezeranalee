src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-10-at-12.44.58-PM-1024x568.png><h3 id=h-who-is-jessa-duggar>Who Is Jessa Duggar?</h3><p>Jessa Duggar is the fifth of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar’s 19 children.</p><p>It’s probably easy to feel lost in the crowd when you have that many siblings, but there are a few things that set Jessa apart from the pack:</p><p>For starters, when the <a href=#>first Josh Duggar sex scandal</a> led to the cancelation of 19 Kids and Counting, Jessa and her elder sister Jill found themselves at the center of the family’s rebranding efforts.</p><p>After 19 Kids was canned, a new show, entitled Jill and Jessa: Counting On, took its place.</p><p>Eventually, the title was changed to just Counting On, and the focus expanded to once again include the entire Duggar family (allegedly at Jim Bob’s insistence).</p><p>Shortly thereafter, <a href=#>Jill quit the show and cut ties with Jim Bob</a>, but Jessa remained a dutiful contributor to the Duggar media empire until the whole thing exploded amid Josh Duggar’s arrest on child pornography charges.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>This loyalty has led many to conclude that Jessa is now her father’s favorite.</p><p>Some say she’s solidified that position by following in her parents’ footsteps and creating a large family at a very young age.</p><p>Duggar women are taught from a young age that procreation is their primary reason for being, and it’s their sacred duty to populate the planet with “soldiers for Christ.”</p><p>Jessa has two older sisters, but Jana is still single, and it doesn’t look like Jill is planning to have any more kids.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Jana Duggar: Answers to All of Your Questions About the Eldest Duggar

though Jessa is just getting started.</p><h3 id=h-how-old-is-jessa-duggar>How Old Is Jessa Duggar?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

November 4, 1992, which makes her 30 years old.</p><p>Like all of her siblings, she was born in Tontitown, Arkansas, where most of her family members still reside today.</p><p>Though she has four older siblings, Jessa is the only one to abide by her parents wishes that all of their children marry at a very young age and raise a large family (oh, and stay out of prison).</p><h3 id=h-when-did-jessa-duggar-get-married>When Did Jessa Duggar Get Married?</h3><p>Jessa Duggar married Ben Seewald on November 1, 2014.</p><p>The wedding took place just days before her 22nd birthday, and as was the Duggars’ custom in those days, it was a lavish affair with hundreds of guests in attendance.</p><p>The couple got engaged only after Ben survived Jim Bob’s rigorous vetting process (during which suitors are made to fill out a <a href=#>423-question application</a>), and in keeping with the family’s beliefs, they saved their first kiss for their wedding day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><h3 id=h-how-many-kids-does-jessa-duggar-have>How Many Kids Does Jessa Duggar Have?</h3><p>Jessa Duggar is a mother of four.</p><p>She welcomed her first child, a boy named Spurgeon, on November 6, 2015, just over a year after she and Ben tied the knot.</p><p>In the years that followed, the couple welcomed three more kids in rapid succession — another boy, named Henry, and two girls, named Ivy and Fern.</p><p>The situation lead observers to note that Jessa was the Duggar daughter who seemed most likely to adhere to her parents’ views on family planning.</p><p>But after experiencing complications during her fifth pregnancy, Jessa may have decided that four is enough.</p><p>And that brings us to our next question.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h3 id=h-did-jessa-duggar-have-an-abortion>Did Jessa Duggar Have an Abortion?</h3><p>On February 24, 2023, the Seewalds posted a YouTube video in which they revealed that Jessa had suffered a miscarriage.</p><p>Specifically, <a href=#>Jessa was rushed to the hospital for a life-saving dilatation and curettage</a> procedure in the eleventh week of her fifth pregnancy.</p><p>The Duggars are militantly anti-choice, and <a href=#>Jessa was slammed as a hypocrite</a> by critics who claimed that she made an exception for herself while crusading to deny potentially life-saving medical care to other pregnant women.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Jessa has repeatedly denied these allegations, claiming that the procedure she underwent does not qualify as an abortion.</p><p>Critics maintain that Jessa is merely splitting hairs.</p><p>Jessa has been keeping a much lower profile in the months since news of the procedure went public, and many fans believe that when she returns to the spotlight she’ll be eager to share some exciting news …</p><h3 id=h-is-jessa-duggar-pregnant>Is Jessa Duggar Pregnant?</h3><p>Rumors that Jessa is pregnant have been circulating for quite some time, but the 30-year-old mother of four has neither confirmed nor denied those reports.</p><p>Of course, she also hasn’t posted on social media in nearly two months, and many fans suspect that she’s keeping a low profile in order to conceal a baby bump.</p><p>The Duggars are a high-profile family, but there aren’t many paparazzi in Arkansas, so we probably won’t know if Jessa is expecting until she chooses to address the matter publicly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h3 id=h-does-jessa-duggar-talk-to-her-parents>Does Jessa Duggar Talk to Her Parents?</h3><p>Another common topic in recent discussions about Jessa is how she’s managed to cope with the many recent scandals involving her family.</p><p>While Jill Duggar has cut ties with her parents, it appears that Jessa is still in regular contact with both Jim Bob and Michelle.</p><p>This is another issue that Jessa doesn’t discuss publicly, and we’re sure she shares many of her elder sister’s complaints about her upbringing, especially since both women were victimized by Josh.</p><a href=#><img width=2656 height=1384
