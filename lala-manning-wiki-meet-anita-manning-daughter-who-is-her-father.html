Daughter of Anita Manning</h2><p>Lala Manning is well-known as Anita Manning’s daughter. Lala and Anita are a well-known mother-daughter team that founded Glasgow auction house Great Western Auctions in 1989.&nbsp;Lala, like her mother, is devoted to her profession. As a result, she elected to follow in her mother’s footsteps. She is, however, less well-known than her mother.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lala-Manning-1.jpg><p>Despite this, Lala has benefited much from her mother’s celebrity. Furthermore, Lala rose to prominence after hosting The Great Western Auctions Ltd, which has subsequently appeared on Flog It, Bargain Hunt, and Cash in the Attic. The celebrity child does not want her personal information extensively publicized on the internet. As a result, her age and birth date have remained unknown.</p><h2>Who is the father of Lala? Anita’s Husband’s Name Revealed</h2><p>Netizens often inquire about Lala’s father and if Anita is married, despite the fact that she has seldom discussed her marital life on media grounds.
