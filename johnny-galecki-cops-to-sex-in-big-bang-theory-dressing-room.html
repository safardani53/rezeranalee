Just FYI!”</p><p>None of the other costars raised their hands, though Helberg, 38, jokingly chimed in, “We all used Johnny’s dressing room.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Late-Show-With-Stephen-Colbert-The-Big-Bang-Theory-Cast.jpg><p>Galecki and Cuoco <a href=#>secretly dated for nearly two years</a>, starting when Big Bang premiered in 2007. “It was such a huge part of my life and no one knew about it,” the 8 Simple Rules alum revealed during a 2010 interview with CBS Watch! magazine. “It was a wonderful relationship, but we never spoke a word about it.”</p><p>Earlier this month, Cuoco opened up about <a href=#>continuing to work with Galecki</a> after their split. “When we broke up, it was funny because that was when our relationship on the show was hot and heavy. There were a lot of bed scenes,” she told Haute Living Los Angeles. “We were a little like, ‘We were trying to end the relationship and it kept falling back in.’ We got over it really fast, and we’re closer than ever now. It could have gone either way, and I was really proud of us.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Thursday’s Big Bang finale revealed that <a href=#>Leonard and Penny were expecting</a>.
