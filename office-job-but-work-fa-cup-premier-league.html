It's the first game you look out for when the fixture list is released ahead of the new season, with the potential to make history and play against your heroes.
Premier League and Championship clubs begin their tournament at the Third Round stage in January.
That is when the competition becomes relevant for the majority of football fans."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

If successful, the preliminary round follows.</p><p>And yes, you have to win two preliminary games just to get into the First Qualifying Round.</p><p>You're playing at that early stage of the tournament knowing there is next to zero chance you will come up against a professional side, let alone win it.</p><p>Yet it remains the highlight of the year, for you could be part of that one club which goes on an historic run and enjoys a day out playing in front of thousands - just as you dreamt of doing as a child.</p><p>But you have to earn the right to get there, which normally involves playing in front of 200 people - most of whom are club officials, parents or people who would rather be elsewhere.</p><p>Look at this season for example, with Cray Valley (PM) FC earning a 1-1 draw at Charlton Athletic in front of thousands of fans before losing out in a replay shown live on BT Sport.</p><p>AFC Stoneham, who play at the same level as me, earned a lucrative away tie with at former Championship side Yeovil Town in the Third Qualifying Round.</p><p>Stretching back beyond this season, eighth tier Chasetown hosted Cardiff City in 2008 and Farnborough went up against the giants of Arsenal in 2003.</p><p>I play in the Combined Counties Premier Division South - the ninth tier of the English Football League pyramid.</p><p>You arrive at 1.15pm for a 3pm kick-off, listen to music on an average speaker and catch-up with the plumbers, builders, teachers and salesmen that make up your team - many of whom have come straight from work.</p><p>You're cramped in a tight changing room, fighting over the last few sweets and drinks, debating who can get some treatment from the one physio before the other and jostling for space as you put your socks on.</p><p>The manager comes in at 1.45pm to give you the pre-match brief, before heading out for a warm-up and come to the deflating realisation you have to spend 90 minutes on a bobbly pitch where the ball is as likely to come off your shin as it is your foot.</p><p>But the location of any FA Cup fixture has no bearing on the excitement of the occasion - and a victory is celebrated like no other.</p><p>My favourite footballing memory is blasting out 5, 6, 7, 8 by Steps after winning an FA Cup extra preliminary round replay in front of 600 people on a Tuesday night.</p><p>With a win on a Saturday, the buzz continues into Sunday, then as you begin to come down on a Monday, it all reignites as you tune in to see who you've been drawn against in the next round.</p><p>Players and fans at the likes of Chesterfield, at the top of the National League, will dream of a tie away at to Manchester United at Old Trafford.</p><p>Meanwhile, there's us us dreaming of a tie away at Chesterfield.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>Don't let Premier League managers, players or pundits have you believe the magic of the FA Cup has dwindled.</p><p>The spark is alive and kicking, literally, for the hundreds of us who have not quite made it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/sun-journalist-semi-pro-footballer-867507900.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/sun-journalist-semi-pro-footballer-867507496.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/WhatsApp-Image-2023-12-15-at-12.36.46-1.jpeg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH91gY9uaG9vX6Szp7XCnmSjp5Jir7bAjLCmq6Ndm65ur9SpZKmqlaK2pr6MpZyan6WafA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
