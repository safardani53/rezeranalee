You have donated more than 10,000 blankets since we joined forces last month with Bliss, the UK’s leading charity dedicated to babies born early or unwell, to launch our Knit A Lot, Help A Tot festive appeal.
After we asked for blankets for babies in neonatal wards, knitters from all over the country got out their needles and wool."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Thank you so much.”</p><p>The blankets you have sent in will go to mums just like Tammy Mullen, 34, who was in hospital in April at the height of the Covid pandemic with her newborn twin sons, Miles and Elijah.</p><p>Tammy, a sales assistant from Launceston, Cornwall, told how blankets were essential to keeping her tiny sons wrapped up warm.</p><p>She said: “The boys were too small for baby clothes at first, so it was vital for us to have blankets available in the neonatal unit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000623616581.jpg><p>"The hospital gave us some to use that people had knitted and donated, and we really appreciated them.”</p><p>Tammy had a caesarean at 34 weeks. Miles weighed 3lb 8oz and Elijah 4lb 4oz, so they were whisked straight to the neonatal unit, where they stayed for 31 days.</p><p>The new mum was discharged after 27 hours, but Covid restrictions meant she and partner Shayne, 34, a factory line operator, were not allowed to visit the boys together.</p><p>Tammy explained: “It was such a stressful time since only one of us could visit at a time. The hospital was 50 miles away and I couldn’t drive after the C-section, so Shayne had to wait for me outside.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">How to make your blanket</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000620221897.jpg><p><strong>Pattern for 24in x 30in baby blanket</strong></p><p><strong>YOU NEED: </strong>250grams double knit yarn and 4mm needles (size 8).

We visited every day but only had a couple of hours with them.</p><p>“It was really important they had something with my scent on. The blankets were placed on the boys in the incubators with the scent on them from when we could cuddle them with the blanket.</p><p>“That’s why blankets for the neonatal unit were so vital for our family. Your campaign is utterly fantastic and will help so many parents and babies just like us.”</p><p>Blankets started flooding into our storage hub at East London Textiles Ltd within days of the appeal being launched.</p><p>Now crate-loads are being carefully looked after by staff at The Big Yellow Self Storage Company, including Romford assistant store manager Jag Bhamber, 40, and we will start to distribute them this week.</p><h2>FEELGOOD FACTOR</h2><p>Jim Gibson, CEO of Big Yellow Self Storage, said: “We have received a huge amount of blankets from so many generous Sun on Sunday readers.

So many people were keen to help these babies this Christmas.”</p><p>One group of knitters was a class of students who taught themselves the skill so they could help out.</p><p>Teacher Grace Parker, 28, told how her all-female tutor group, from Exeter College, Devon, got started.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Where to send your finished blankets</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000619879832.jpg><p>PLEASE post blankets to: The Sun on Sunday’s Christmas Blankets for Babies Appeal, East London Textiles Ltd (E.L.T.), Unit G4, Gallmans End Farm, Manor Road, Abridge, Essex RM4 1NA.</p><p>Bliss is unable to accept blankets sent directly to its office.</p><p>All blankets will be quality controlled.
