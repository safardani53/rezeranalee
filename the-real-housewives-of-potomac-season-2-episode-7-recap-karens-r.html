She revealed that she was raped, and was set to speak at a foundation benefiting rape victims.&nbsp;</p><p>Karen felt like it would be a good way to open up about her thoughts about the traumatic event because she never opened up about it all those years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>She wants her story to help young girls and women who went through something similar. The great thing about this reveal was that it brought all of the women together.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>They’ve been at odds for the better part of the season, so it’s great to see them play nice. It just sucks that it takes something like this to bring them together.&nbsp;</p><p>The ladies sat listening to Karen’s emotional and empowering speech about her ordeal, and it was heartwarming to see everyone so close together.&nbsp;</p><p>After this, it was revealed that Robyn was still unimpressed by the interest her friends were taking in her relationship with Juan. She was shocked at the way Gizelle and Charrisse&nbsp;acted but commended them for handling it better in a one-to-one situation.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Ashley, however, was not getting off lightly and Robyn and Gizelle thought it would be a good idea to go to her place of work and start all of the drama up again.&nbsp;</p><p>The argument was a bit of a dud. Ashley did not back down and even managed to get the upper hand by throwing both women out of her place of work.&nbsp;</p><p>Things got totally awkward when a microphone picked up a conversation between Juan and one of the producers. He was claiming he was "fed up" of Robyn and the way she acted.&nbsp;</p><p>He then said he would have ditched Robyn a long time ago if it was not for their children. Yikes. Poor Robyn did not hear any of it and continued with her day-to-day life.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Charrisse then took her to a therapy session, in which Robyn broke down into floods of tears when she was probed for answers.&nbsp;</p><p>Was this the best way to force her to the realization that her marriage was in tatters? Nope. Did it make for heartbreaking TV? Yes.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere, Charrisse was forced to open up to her daughter about her looming divorce to Eddie. Her daughter did not seem to be amused, but her mother felt like it was time.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>At Karen’s event, only Monique was civil to Ashley. All of the other women were still pissed at the way she had acted before.&nbsp;</p><p>Monique tried to use this as an opportunity to mend fences with Gizelle, but it did not go to plan, and Gizelle shrugged at her.&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah, something tells us these two will not be making nice soon.&nbsp;</p><p>What did you think of all the drama?</p><p>Sound off below!</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>19 Real Housewives Who Only Lasted One Season</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WCcMDHnmSrnZGheqm71KycsKGmmsBuu8Vmp6isn6KupHnSnpisp55if26xz6KqqJyVYoRuvsScmKllm5a%2FprrSZqlo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
