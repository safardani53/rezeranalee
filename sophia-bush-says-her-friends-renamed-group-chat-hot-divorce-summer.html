A second source told Us that the twosome started off as “just friends,” but they “<a href=#>bonded over their breakups</a> and having to start over.”</p><p>After Harris and Bush’s speculated romance made headlines, <a href=#>Hughes reacted</a> to the news. “Grant will always want the best for Sophia, and is supportive of all that makes her happy and fulfilled,” a rep for Hughes told Page Six at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasp6CdtqJ5wa6qoWWjlsa0eceeqWaeop6yr7DSZqmeppGisqV5xqumrqhdmLWiwIyhpq1llJ7DsL7CnmSsrZ2isrN7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
