But the 18-year-old Disney star did just that, and new reports are claiming that Demi could be a “cutter” — a self-inflicted form of mutilation. A source close to Demi and her camp tell <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> that she’s been suffering with cutting for a long time. But a “physical altercation” with a dancer on her tour is what sent her over the edge.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>“She’s not going to be back on this tour with the Jonas Brothers,” says a source. “She has a very long history of battling cutting and eating disorders.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span>A spokesperson for Disney tells <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> “We support Demi’s decision to put her health first and we send her our best wishes.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Demi’s rep made a statement Nov. 1, stating that Demi indeed was seeking help in order to deal with &nbsp;“emotional and physical issues she has dealt with for some time. Demi has decided to take personal responsibility for her actions and seek help.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Our source also tells us that Demi was bullied all throughout her childhood.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><span>Several photos taken over the past two years show Demi with marks on her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrists</a>. One photo in particular caused quite a stir, it was taken in October of 2008 at Miley Cyrus’ 16th birthday party in Disneyland, and Demi had very prevalent marks on her left wrist,&nbsp;<span>something her rep claimed were due to wearing tight bracelets.</span></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7><span>“Demi was wearing gummy bracelets just prior to her appearance on the red carpet and, because of how tight they were, they left indentations on her wrist,” said her publicist. “These allegations are completely false.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8><span>Demi has been in South America touring with the Jonas Brothers, and she was scheduled to perform in Buenos Aires today. It was reported that an “altercation” with another girl on tour was the “catalyst” for Demi checking into rehab. Demi’s fans are even speculating that this has everything to do with her ex-boyfriend, <strong>Joe Jonas</strong>‘&nbsp;new hot and heavy romance with&nbsp;Twilight hottie, <strong>Ashley Greene</strong> — and the fact that he brought her on tour with him.</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9><span>“She is doing just that. Demi and her family ask that the media please respect their privacy during this difficult time,” said her rep. “She regrets not being able to finish her tour, but is looking forward to getting back to work in the near future.”</span></p><h3>— Chloe Melas</h3><h3><a href=# rel=noopener>Click Here to Read Expert Opinions On Why A Star Like Demi Would Cut Themself!</a></h3><h3>Check Out Ashley Greene’s Insensitive Tweet From the Jonas Concert!</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlgZH5ye49rZp2dnZ56rbvVmquoZaKataKujJ2grKaVrnqkwdOtoKefXZ%2B8pnnJqKWaq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
