Clearly, Precious‚Äô family wanted to honor their late family member in a big way, because they went all out for the occasion. Live music, dancing, amazing food, you name it! Precious‚Äô funeral was a vivacious celebration of her life, and smiles replaced the usual frowns we‚Äôre so used to seeing at somber occasions. How do we know? <strong>Tiny Harris</strong>, 43<strong>,</strong> shared a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video from the bash</a> with all of her followers! The Xscape singer shared a short clip with the most endearing message about what went down that night. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt play about you when u were living sis & we didn‚Äôt play with u taking u out of here. U went up the strong way @preciousharris1913 u would of been like Whuuuutt!! I‚Äôm a superstar! Your home going just showed how special of an individual u are!! U woulda been proud,‚Äù the wife of T.I. said to her 5.6 millions followers.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Of course, Precious‚Äô brother shared a moving message about her at the event, and Tiny made sure to shout out her man. ‚ÄúYour brother did an amazing speech about u, your son too! @kamayadaplug Stepped up & made sure u everything u was suppose to have,‚Äù Tiny went on to say in her post.

Shine on sis!!‚Äù Tiny revealed. We can only hope Precious got wind of the epic party thrown in her wake!&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The night‚Äôs festivities carried on as T.I. himself took to the stage with a hard-hitting performance. As neon strobe lights flashed, TIP had the whole crowd up and dancing! In a video shared to his Instagram, it looked like the night‚Äôs attendees were a massive sea of dance moves as the rapper riled up the crowd onstage. ‚ÄúYeah Sis we was LIT lit üî• #LongLivePreciousHarris,‚Äù he captioned the video clip.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The news of Precious‚Äô <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>passing</a> first broke on Feb 22, nine days after she had suffered <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a tragic car accident</a> on Feb. 13. The 66-year-old woman had an asthma attack while driving a 2013 Dodge Avenger in Atlanta, according to the Atlana PD traffic accident report that <strong>HollywoodLife </strong>obtained. The report claimed that her granddaughter&nbsp;<strong>Kairi</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Chapman</strong>, who was in the car, told the responding officer that Precious ‚Äúwent unconscious and veered into a telephone pole.‚Äù While Precious‚Äô family is undoubtedly still heartbroken over her sudden passing, we love the vibrant way they chose to honor her at the funeral. Rest in peace, Precious!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH10e49tZqmqlZi2sMHSZp%2BaqqKewG6y1Kecq5mcYsGquthmq6Jlpp6xprvSZq6arJOdfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
