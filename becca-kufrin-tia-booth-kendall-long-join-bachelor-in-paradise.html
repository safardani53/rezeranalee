Following the Monday, August 9, <a href=#>Bachelorette</a> finale, during which <a href=#><strong>Katie Thurston</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Blake Moynes</strong></a> got engaged, it was time to introduce what’s next: <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a>.</p><p>After two years off, the fan-favorite spinoff is returning for its seventh season.

While Tia famously had a fling with <a href=#><strong>Colton Underwood</strong></a> during the show, Kendall found love with <a href=#><strong>Joe Amabile</strong></a> — who is also back this season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Becca-Kufrin-Tia-Booth-Kendall-Long-Bachelor-in-Paradise.jpg><p>Kendall and Joe, 34, moved in together in 2019 <a href=#>but split in January 2020</a>. Earlier this year, she admitted that while she wants her ex to find love, it would be “so hard” to watch him fall for someone on Paradise.</p><p>“I still have a tremendous amount of love for him,” she said during the May interview, adding that if they were both invited to the spinoff,<a href=#> she’d probably say no</a>. “It would be really difficult. … I would just be signing up for another heartbreak.”</p><p>Well, it looks like she said yes. In the new trailer, the Dancing With the Stars alum is <a href=#>seen getting very close</a> with <strong>Serena Pitt</strong>, flirting and kissing the 23-year-old Bachelor alum. When Kendall arrives, he asks, “Why did you come here?” She then responds, “Why did you come here?” before the pair engage in a hug. Serena is shown crying.</p><p>Becca, 31, meanwhile, seems to be enjoying herself. The season 14 Bachelorette has been single since September 2020, when she announced the end of <a href=#>her engagement to <strong>Garrett Yrigoyen</strong></a>. In the new trailer, she admits, “I can’t stop smiling,” while on a date with <strong>Thomas Jacobs</strong>, <a href=#>the villain from Katie’s season</a> of The Bachelorette.</p><p>While Tia doesn’t appear to find a deep connection in the first look, she still does a fair share of flirting with <a href=#><strong>Kenny Braasch</strong></a>, joking with him about getting naked while they stand together on the beach.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>During the trailer, Kenny, 39, seems a bit preoccupied with many prospects, including <a href=#><strong>Demi Burnett</strong></a>. The pair engage in multiple steamy kisses and she tells the cameras she wants to take him to “the boom boom room.” Demi, 26, is also spotted kissing <strong>Brendan Morais</strong>, while <strong>Mari Pepin-Solis</strong> is vying for Kenny.</p><p>Bachelor in Paradise premieres on ABC Monday, August 16, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmem5OWeqzBxaugp2Wknq5urs6oq6Flm5q7pa3LpWSlp56cequ7yKdkm5mTnbKtu9FmoKdloJa%2ForDIrJxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
