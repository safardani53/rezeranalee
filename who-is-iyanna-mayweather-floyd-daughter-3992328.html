Her dad revealed the news during an interview with Hollywood Unlocked: Uncensored on Oct. 30, which can be seen below, after rumors started to spread and said he is “happy” for her and the baby-to-be’s father, <strong>NBA Young Boy</strong>, 21. despite their rocky past. “Always want the best.

Floyd also addressed how the rapper made headlines for calling him Yaya’s “b*tch a** daddy” in an Instagram Live chat, which can be seen below, and admitted he’s not letting it bother him.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Well, my thing is this: it has to do with your upbringing,” the boxer explained. “It starts in the home first. What I’ve always taught my daughter is this: always be respectful when you’re going to anyone’s home. And whatever goes on in your home, don’t talk about it to the world.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>NBA Youngboy goes off on Kodak Black for saying be cooperated with the police after the arrest of Floyd Mayweather daughter “Yaya” for stabbing his baby moms <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/mnkr2h2LTT</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>— DJ Akademiks (@Akademiks) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>April 5, 2020</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“As far as NBA… I look at NBA Young Boy as a child,” he continued. “I can’t get upset with a kid like that.

Iyanna was arrested for allegedly stabbing another woman who was allegedly hanging out with NBA Young Boy in Apr., according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a></strong>. A Houston Police Department source also confirmed to <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> that she was arrested. However, other details were not disclosed since it’s an ongoing investigation. Iyanna was busted on charges of felony aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, sources told TMZ, after she allegedly went to rapper NBA Young Boy’s house in Houston, Texas around 1:30 A.M. on April 4. Iyanna allegedly confronted a woman who was with him, identified as <strong>Lapattra Lashai Jacobs</strong>, in the report.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Iyanna claimed she was rapper NBA Young Boy’s fiance and told Lapattra to leave the house, before allegedly charging at her with two knives and stabbing her twice, TMZ reported. When speaking to police following the incident, Iyanna told the cops that she had never met the woman, and was provoked when Lapattra yanked her hair before the alleged stabbing.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13><strong>2. Iyanna was bonded for $30,000. HollywoodLife</strong> confirmed with a source at the Houston Police Department that Floyd’s daughter was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>arrested and bonded</a> for $30,000 and a court case is reportedly still in process.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>3. Young Boy and Lapattra reportedly have a child together. </strong>The pair, who were both at the rapper’s house in Texas when Iyanna arrived, have a child together according to the&nbsp;TMZ&nbsp;report. Young Boy has five children in total, including <strong>Kayden, Kamron, Taylin</strong> and <strong>Kamiri</strong>, and one he announced was on the way in July 2020.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15><strong>4. Drake and Future performed at Iyanna’s Sweet 16.</strong> Back in 2016, the legendary boxer threw a mega party for his daughter, and had&nbsp;two of the&nbsp;biggest names in the music industry&nbsp;perform:&nbsp;<strong>Drake</strong>, and <strong>Future</strong>. Drake sang some of his biggest hits, including “One Dance,” “Energy,” and “Back To Back.” And although this was just a birthday party for kids, Drake didn’t let that stop him from giving his audience an incredible show! The same went for Future as he hit the stage accompanied by <strong>DJ Esco</strong>&nbsp;who also danced and performed right alongside the rapper.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16><strong>5. The stabbing incident occurred just weeks after Iyanna’s half-sibling’s mom passed away. Josie Harris</strong>, the 40-year-old former long-term partner of&nbsp;Floyd Mayweather Jr., <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was found dead</a> in Valencia, California, on March 10. The pair shared two sons <strong>Koraun Mayweather</strong>, 21, and <strong>Zion Shamaree</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Mayweather</strong>, 18 — half-siblings to Iyanna.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K2uq3Np5hmpZGuxKat06Gcq2WWoby6sIydmK6fmKmys3mScnBra2JtfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
