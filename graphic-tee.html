We have compiled a comprehensive buying guide to help you make a smarter purchase.</p><h3>What Are the Most Important Criterias To Consider When Buying Graphic Tees?</h3><p>If you are in the market to get a tee, keep these things in mind.</p><h4>Fabric type</h4><p>The type of fabric you pick makes or breaks the quality of your t-shirt. Most tees are made from natural fabrics, like cotton, and synthetic fabrics, like nylon and polyester. If you want a stretchable material, then opt for a blend of natural and artificial. On the other hand, regular fit items are mostly made from natural products.</p><h4>Fitting</h4><p>The right fit for your t-shirt can enhance your figure. Darker colors help you look slim and sleek, while light colors are more figure-enhancing. Choose what you feel comfortable in!</p><h4>Designs</h4><p>The best thing about graphic tees is their design. Different designs feature animations, cartoon characters, and famous sayings, which are all a great way to represent your personality.</p><h4>Occasion</h4><p>T-shirts are a perfect wardrobe essential for all kinds of casual occasions. You can wear tees to different events such as birthday parties, lunch dates, grocery hauls, and shopping sprees. However, they are not a suitable choice for formal or semi-formal occasions.</p><h4>Neck style</h4><p>The most common style is a crew neck, which enhances your neck and chest. There are modern styles like a v-neck or a high-neck, but most people do not prefer them for graphic tees. The kind of neck style you pick depends on your physique and body type, so get something that you feel comfortable in.</p><h4>Color</h4><p>When it comes to clothing, color is always a key contributor. You’ll find graphic t-shirts in almost every color, so ultimately, the choice should be whatever you like best.</p><h3>How Can You Fit a Graphic Tee Perfectly?</h3><p>A graphic tee can be either too tight or too loose. While most of us are okay with loose shirts, tighter fits can be pretty frustrating. Enlisted below is a simple method to help you find a perfect-fitting t-shirt.</p><h4>Fit</h4><p>Having a slim-fit tee doesn't mean it should suffocate you. A slim-fit shirt is lightweight on your body and doesn’t irritate you or look way too tight. These t-shirts make your figure more prominent, so slim fit might irritate you if you are unsure about your body confidence. Loose-fitting is one or two sizes larger than your actual size and conceals different parts of your body, like your stomach or arms (and even legs, depending on how long it is). While these shirts look large, they don't make your figure prominent. Some people tuck in their loose tees for an enhancing look.</p><p>To find a suitable fit, you’ll need to measure from the middle of your neck to the end of your shoulders for upper body measurements. Then measure from one shoulder to the other and finally measure around your chest. For slim-fit shirts, you need to measure the abdomen as well.</p><h4>Length</h4><p>The length of your shirt should be somewhere between the top to the midsection of your crotch. Most people prefer that it comes to the core of the crotch as it avoids showing the stomach every time you reach up to grab something. Although some women prefer shorter tees, as it enhances their figure, males mostly prefer a classic fit. A longer shirt is also easier to tuck in if you choose to wear your shirt that way.</p><h4>Sleeves</h4><p>You don't need measuring tape or tailor recommendations to find the right sleeve length on t-shirts. The perfect sleeve fits somewhere between your armpit and elbow. However, most shirts for females come with shorter sleeves, but it all depends on personal preference.</p><h3>What Are Some Common Visuals on a Graphic Tee?</h3><p>Here are the most common things you might find printed on a graphic tee:</p><h4>Quotes</h4><p>Sometimes a quote might go viral for all the right reasons. Whether you are a Star Wars fan or have an obsessive love for Michael Scott, there is a t-shirt out there for you that has famous quotes printed on them.</p><h4>Characters</h4><p>Cartoon characters and animations have been a top priority among a lot of people - even adults. If you want to dive back to your childhood roots or are super inspired by a particular character, it is highly likely you’ll find a t-shirt with your favorite characters on it.</p><h4>Random images</h4><p>Butterflies, dollar signs, tick marks, and music signs are all printed on t-shirts. They are primarily a representation of your personality and what your thoughts revolve around. Everyone should be able to find a tee with some random symbol built on it that speaks to them.</p><h4>Brand logo</h4><p>Nike, Adidas, Apple, and many other companies can be recognized from a distance because of their logos. You can buy a branded tee with a logo graphic that helps people remember your sharp sense of style.</p><h3>What Are the Different Neck Styles of Graphic Tees?</h3><p>Like simple t-shirts, you can find graphic tees in the following neck styles.</p><h4>Crew neck</h4><p>One of men's fashion's most commonly used styles, a crew neck tee has a round circular neckline that allows a perfect fit right on top of the collarbone. While males mainly prefer this style, a lot of women are also huge fans. The best thing about a crew neck graphic t-shirt is that it makes your figure incredibly prominent, which is great.</p><h4>V-neck</h4><p>One of the most contemporary neck styles is a V-shape at the neck. People who have a round face and figure use these to look sleek and slim. If you already have a slim figure, a V-neck shirt will enhance your collarbones and make them look more prominent.</p><h4>Y-neck</h4><p>A Y-Neck is a hybrid between V- and acre-neck tees, as it comes with buttons over an oval-shaped neckline. Mostly worn by men of muscular stature, it increases their aesthetic appeal while enhancing their stature.</p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>Graphic tees are a great addition to any wardrobe. While they provide a great overall look, these t-shirts can represent your personality in an extremely positive way. You can buy one of the top graphic tees in 2022 by considering the type of fabric, color, designs, and of course, your favorite designs carefully. Remember that the color and fitting directly impact your figure, so make sure you find something that complements your body nicely!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGipnq6ZmsRwrc%2BpmKudnGS0s63PoaCcZaSasnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
