Then it comes a time when the good doesn’t outweigh the bad anymore where it’s time to walk away,” she said at the time.&nbsp;“Personally, I feel like I walked away at a time that was right for me and that’s how Cam and Chelsea feel too. Other people that aren’t ready to walk away and want to keep doing it, that’s their prerogative and I’m very supportive of that. I still love most of the people on there.”</p><p>However, the Bravo personality admitted that she <a href=#>isn’t in a good place</a> with <a href=#><strong>Kathryn Dennis</strong></a>.</p><p>“I mean, I feel kind of bad saying, but I think I can say I have a strained relationship with Kathryn because I struggle with her filming strategy I guess,” she explained. “I have a relationship with pretty much everybody, except for Kathryn I would say.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kathryn, for her part, doesn’t seem to have plans to leave Charleston any time soon.
