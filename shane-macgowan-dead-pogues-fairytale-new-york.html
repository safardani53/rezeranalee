So many of his songs would be perfectly crafted poems, if that would not have deprived us of the opportunity to hear him sing them.</p><p>"The genius of Shane’s contribution includes the fact that his songs capture within them, as Shane would put it, the measure of our dreams - of so many worlds, and particularly those of love, of the emigrant experience and of facing the challenges of that experience with authenticity and courage, and of living and seeing the sides of life that so many turn away from.</p><p>"His words have connected Irish people all over the globe to their culture and history, encompassing so many human emotions in the most poetic of ways."</p><p>Shane's mother, Therese, was also a singer and was an inspiration in the Pogue star's life and music career.</p><p>President Higgins continued: "Shane’s talent was nurtured from a young age by his mother Therese, herself an award winning folk singer in her own right.</p><p>"Therese, who lost her life in such tragic circumstances on New Year’s Day 2017, inspired in Shane the love of Irish music and traditions which resulted in the wonderful music and lyrics which have been a source of such joy for so many people.</p><p>"Born on Christmas Day, there was perhaps some form of destiny which led Shane to writing ‘Fairytale of New York’, the timeless quality of which will surely mean that it will be listened to every Christmas for the next century or more.</p><p>"Likewise songs like ‘Rainy Night in Soho’, ‘A Pair of Brown Eyes’, ‘If I Should Fall from Grace with God’ and so many others will live on far into the years and decades to come.</p><p>"I think too of ‘Haunted’, and the particular poignancy that both Shane and Sinead O’Connor have left us in such quick succession."</p><p>One of Shane's last public appearances was in 2018 at a special 60th birthday celebration at the National Concert Hall in Dublin.</p><p>Celebrities and Shane's close pals such as Johnny Depp, Bono, Sinead O'Connor and Cerys Matthews performed his songs while President Higgins presented him with a Lifetime Achievement Award.</p><p>President Higgins described the presentation as "a great honour for me. A richly deserved honour."</p><p>He added: "On behalf of Sabina and I, may I extend my deepest condolences to Shane’s wife Victoria, his sister Siobhan, his father Maurice, his bandmates in the Pogues and other projects, and to all his many friends and family."</p><p>Shane's bandmate Peter "Spider" Stacy paid tribute to his fellow Pogues co-founder, sharing an image of him performing on a stage.</p><p>Taking to X, formerly Twitter, Stacy wrote: "'O Captain! My Captain! Our fearful trip is done..'"</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>RISE OF THE POGUES</h2><p>Shane was born on Christmas Day in Pembury, Kent, in 1957 to Irish parents - his father worked in retail and his mother was an Irish dancer.</p><p>He soon moved to rural Tipperary where he was immersed in an Irish culture of ceili bands and showbands before the family moved back to England.</p><p>Shane was expelled from a prestigious Westminster School in London in his second year when he was caught in possession of drugs.</p><p>He later claimed he had not been sober a single day in his life since he was 14.</p><p>In 2001, Sinead O'Connor reported him to the police for drug possession - in what she said was an attempt to discourage him from using heroin.</p><p>The star had always been open about his battle with drug addiction and&nbsp;alcohol&nbsp;abuse, which led him to lose all his teeth by 2008.</p><p>Seven years after Shane lost the last of his teeth, he underwent a nine-hour procedure to fit 28 glowing dentures on a titanium frame and a gold tooth.</p><p>Shane's expulsion led the star to become involved in punk bands and form his own, before the birth of The Pogues in 1982.</p><p>Shane on vocals, Peter “Spider” Tracy on tin whistle, and Jem Finer on banjo were the original members.</p><p>James Fearnley, the accordion player for the Nips, Andrew Ranken on drums, and Cait O’Riordan on bass completed the lineup.</p><p>The band’s initial name, Pogue Mahone, was an anglicization of the phrase “kiss my arse,” póg mo thóin.</p><p>The band played traditional Irish and rebel songs and later performed songs with great depth, thanks to the songwriting talents of MacGowan.</p><p>The band reached their critical peak with the 1985 album Rum, Sodomy and the Lash, and their commercial peak with 1988's If I Should Fall from Grace with God.</p><p>The latter provided the band with their biggest hit, MacGowan duetting with Kirsty MacColl on Fairytale of New York. Although it was kept off the coveted festive number one spot by The Pet Shop Boys, Fairytale regularly tops polls for the best Christmas song.</p><p>However, the band kicked MacGowan out in 1991 after his erratic lifestyle and excessive drinking began to affect his creative output.</p><p>The rock wildman time and time again&nbsp;defied critics who said he had ‘death wish’.</p><p>The Tipperary rocker once told the Irish Sun: “All the people who used to say that I had a death wish and that I wouldn’t see 30 — where are they now? If I had a death wish, I’d be dead.”</p><p>Shane formed his own band, The Popes, and toured extensively, but was back with The Pogues in 2001.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'BONES TURNED TO DUST'</h2><p>In September 2020, a new documentary, Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds with Shane MacGowan, was released Directed by Julien Temple and produced by Johnny Depp.</p><p>It featured unseen archival footage from the band and MacGowan's family, as well as animation from illustrator Ralph Steadman.</p><p>In 2021, it was revealed by Mick Cronin of Irish rock indie band Cronin that MacGowan had recorded with them in May.</p><p>"Once he's in the studio, he's all guns blazing," the drummer told the New York Times.</p><p>In November 2022, MacGowan released his first art book.</p><p>The book, titled The Eternal Buzz and the Crock of Gold, included never-before-seen artwork, handwritten lyrics and school essays.</p><p>Over the last eight years, Shane battled health issues and eventually needed help getting out of bed.</p><p>The rocker's mobility was dramatically reduced after a 2015 fall, which left him with a broken pelvis.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, Shane told Vice that he “fell the wrong way”, which left him “lame in one leg” and unable to walk without a crutch.&nbsp;</p><p>The singer was forced to use a wheelchair in the years that followed and last year, his injuries worsened after he fell and broke his knee shortly after tearing a ligament.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He said at the time: “You find out your bones are turned to dust”.</p><p>But despite his lifestyle, Shane regularly said he was “glad to be alive” and “grateful to wake up”, said wife Victoria.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/NINTCHDBPICT000783092072-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/NINTCHDBPICT000378478301.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhqZG59doSSa2asoJGjsm65wJyeqK%2BRo3qlscCdZKmnl6qytHnFmqCrsaSWuaZ5zZ6uZrGfp7hw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
