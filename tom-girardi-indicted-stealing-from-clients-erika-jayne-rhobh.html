In fact, just last season, there was drama over <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a pair of $750K diamond earrings</a>, which were gifted to Erika, that some of her co-stars said should have been given to the fraud victims. Even <strong>Jon Hamm</strong> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spoke out on the earrings</a>!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Tom, 83, who is the co-founder of the defunct Los Angeles law firm Girardi Keese, has been charged with five counts of wire fraud, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, and that carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Erika-Jayne-Dismissed-From-Fraud-Embezzlement-Lawsuit-Against-Ex-Tom-Girardi-EMBED.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Tom was disbarred in California in July 2022, following the initial accusations of embezzlement, and he has since been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and placed under a conservatorship.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Mr. Girardi and Mr. Kamon stand accused of engaging in a widespread scheme to steal from their clients and lie to them to cover up the fraud,” United States Attorney Martin Estrada said in a press release. “In doing so, they allegedly preyed on the very people who trusted and relied upon them the most-their clients. Actions like the ones alleged in the indictment bring disrepute upon the legal profession and will not be tolerated by my office.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ze49qZq2nnWK0qr7Aq5uiZZmjsaqv056bZqukmq6ttc2gZJ%2Bqn6J6pLjInqWtq12av6q3wGahmrGemnqztM6bn2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
