Below, we'll explore what finds — if any — the brothers have uncovered to date — plus how you can visit there yourself to join in the hunt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Oak Island? Can I go there?</h2><p>Oak Island is a small private isle on the south shore of Nova Scotia, Canada in Mahone Bay. It is currently privately owned. In 2008, the Lagina Brothers purchased a controlling interest in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oak Island Tours</a>, which owned most of the island.&nbsp;</p><p>When they're not treasure hunting themselves, their company leads private and public tours. The bad news is the tours are in such high remand, they're all sold out for the entire year, but cancellations do happen.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But do they ever find any treasure on Oak Island?</h2><p>The Lagina brothers have been exploring the 140-acre island for years, but they've uncovered fairly little, save for a few artifacts. The focus of much of their searches is to find an entrance to The Money Pit. That's not the 1980s comedy starring Tom Hanks and Shelley Long but rather a shaft dug by early explorers and believed by treasure hunters to be the most likely location of treasure.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>According to an account written in 1862, the pit became flooded with seawater when an expedition called the Onslow Company bored a second hole to more easily cart out any treasure. Instead, as the Oak Island Tours site puts it, they ended up with "two shafts full of water and no treasure."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Though the explorers on the show haven't hit pay-dirt yet, they have made some interesting discoveries over the years. In Lot 21, one of the dig sites, Rick and Gary found an antique brooch of copper and gold that was at least 500 years old with a gem they had hoped would be ruby but turned out to be garnet. Still, not bad!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>They've also found several coins that are more than 200 years old, bone fragments, and a lead cross that was made between 1200 and 1600 A.D. While that doesn't seem like much for the years of work the Laginas and their crew have sunk into their expedition, they don't seem to see it that way.</p><p>Every discovery provides more possible clues to the Money Pit and more background in this mysterious island. Plus, the thrill of the hunt seems to be keeping them going.</p><p>The Curse of Oak Island airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET on History.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbxuwMeesGadppq%2FbrLIp5tmmZ6uwam1zaBkqJmbYra0uMCnmw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
