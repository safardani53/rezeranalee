But, as he grew older, he dropped the 'lil' and went by 'Stunna' only.</p><p>Similarly, he adopted the 'Gambino' in his name after being&nbsp;inspired by the Gambino crime family.&nbsp;He was always interested in the Italian mafia and the Gambino family, so he named himself after them.&nbsp;</p><h2>How Old Is Stunna Gambino?</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Gambino has never specified his age. However, many&nbsp;sites&nbsp;report his birthday is on October 11, 2001, making him 19 right now.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>How Did Stunna Gambino Get into Music?</h2><p>Gambino got into music in an unconventional way. During his conversation with Talk of the Town, Gambino said that his older brother forced him to rap when they were younger.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The rapper was basically bullied by his brother to get into music since he could do nothing unless he wrote a verse. Gambino's brother was actually the rapper of the family.&nbsp;</p><p>So, Gambino received that extra push into the music industry. He started rapping when he was nine and took it seriously when he was 13. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But when Gambino started taking music seriously, he overthrew his brother from that pedestal and became the star of the family. He started going to studios and recording with the money he was given as his allowance.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He was influenced by many rappers, but he does not have any specific artist as his role model. Instead, Gambino makes music according to his interest and whatever he vibes with.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>What Is Stunna Gambino’s Ethnicity?</h2><p>Gambino is&nbsp;Dominican and Caribbean.

He is currently in a relationship with a YouTuber named Chanel. The pair have been dating for over a year.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Recently, on August 2, 2021, they celebrated their first anniversary by flying over New York City in a helicopter.&nbsp;</p><h2>Stunna Gambino’s Recent Feats</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Gambino <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rose to prominence</a> in his hometown by remaining loyal to himself.

In 2019,&nbsp;Gambino kept the pressure on and&nbsp;released&nbsp;his first album, Underrated, which featured the standout hit 'Switch Sides.'</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>By then, he had amassed a massive fan base. He also sold out his first performance at&nbsp;SOB’s right after the release of his first album.&nbsp;</p><p>Gambino solidified his place in 2020 with songs like 'Rockstar From The Trenches,'&nbsp;remix of 'Rivals,'&nbsp;and&nbsp;'Demons.'&nbsp;The latter was also promoted by Rihanna&nbsp;in one of her Instagram stories.</p><p>'Demons'&nbsp;has been streamed over 5 million times since the collaboration, making it Gambino's most famous song to date.
