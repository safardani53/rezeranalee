We’ve been dreaming about this one our whole lives,” the guys wrote on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> when they announced the first show in April. “Five albums. One epic night.” The demand for the concert was so high that they followed it up by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>adding</a> a second show one week later. Eventually, it was revealed that the Yankee Stadium shows would be a kick-off to a world tour.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>In the lead up to opening weekend,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kevin Jonas</a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Joe Jonas</a></strong> and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nick Jonas</strong></a> gave fans some hints about what to expect. Plus, they invited 200 lucky fans to a dress rehearsal for <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the tour</a>, and the reactions were overwhelmingly positive.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“We’re playing it all,” Kevin told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong> in an EXCLUSIVE interview on Aug. 11. “Everyone keeps asking what’s on the setlist…and we’re like…EVERYTHING. We’re playing everything on the five albums, and some other singles as well. Yes, every song. Everyone isn’t really [grasping] that.” The guys delivered on that promise with two three-hour shows at Yankee Stadium.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jonas-brothers-yankee-stadium-show-ss-embed1.jpg><h2>Jonas Brothers Setlist</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>For the most part, the JoBros were doing everything they can to keep the songs being included on their setlist under wraps before the show. However, with the tour being titled “Five Albums. One Night. World Tour,” there were PLENTY of songs to choose from (Kevin said they practiced a whopping 109 songs from their catalog to prepare). Although the band actually has six records, they kept songs from their debut album, It’s About Time, off the list. Earlier this year, they played a “Five Albums. One Night” residency on Broadway in New York City, and It’s About Time was not included, either. The guys did not explain why they came to that decision.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jonas-brothers-yankee-stadium-show-ss-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>“We built a fun show all the way around,” Kevin told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a> before the tour. He said that “Australia” from the&nbsp;Jonas Brothers album is one of his favorite songs to play, and Nick confirmed that the band would be playing it live on this tour for the very first time. “I just want to show them that we can play every song on every album,” Joe explained. “I think it’s insane that we were able to put this together. Everything has a special moment, we made sure.” Some of the songs were shortened and played as a medley during the show.

Nick confirmed that there would be an intermission at the Yankee Stadium concerts, and teased that surprise guests would appear before the mid-show break. “They’re very famous,” he dished in an interview with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“The surprise is going to be a combination of different things that don’t necessarily include us,” Nick cryptically added. “In other words, I will be excited watching this moment from backstage and seeing how the audience reacts.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jonas-brothers-yankee-stadium-show-ss-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>At both Yankee Stadium shows, they had their former security guard,&nbsp;<strong>Big Rob</strong>, join them onstage to sing his rap verse in “Burnin’ Up.” They also brought out&nbsp;<strong>Jon Bellion</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Kirk Franklin</strong> to perform “Walls” with them. All of these guests were in attendance for night two, as well, but the biggest surprise of all was an appearance from&nbsp;<strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong>. Jimmy came out after intermission and led the crowd in a karaoke version of “Mr. Brightside.”</p><h2>Who Is Opening For Jonas Brothers At Yankee Stadium?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Before the JoBros take the stage, there will be an opening act to kick off the show. The opening band is called Lawrence, founded by siblings <strong>Clyde Lawrence</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Gracie Lawrence</strong>. The two have been performing music together since they were kids and have expanded their band to an eight-piece group. On Aug. 11, just one day before the first Yankee Stadium show, they’re releasing their newest single, “I’m Confident I’m Insecure.”</p><h2>Jonas Brothers 2023 Tour Dates</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Following the Yankee Stadium shows, the rest of the tour begins.
