OnlyFans’ ban of most NSFW content makes the (previously) adult media subscription site only the latest on a disgraceful list.
We knew that OnlyFans was throwing its content creators, the ones who made the site a household name, to the wolves."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That goes for oral and anal sex as well as genital, in any combination. All banned.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>If you’re thinking "okay, they’re just going softcore now," well … we’re not done.</p><p>Masturbation, whether actual or simulated, is prohibited.</p><p>And while nudity is allowed, zooming in on anybody’s genitals or holes is no longer allowed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>That’s right — closeup shots of anybody’s bits can get you banned.</p><p>There is also a ban on body fluids, which means that the aftermath of sex or masturbation is prohibited.</p><p>And of course, they cannot post teasers promising more for direct customers off of OnlyFans, because they cannot advertise any thing sexually explicit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The new terms require that all of this "sexually explicit conduct" be removed before December 1, 2021 at the latest.</p><p>Users who violate the policy could see their accounts suspended or terminated, or even have access to their earnings revoked.</p><p>That last one sounds like OnlyFans is threatening to keep creators’ money if they break these new rules.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>There’s no more porn on the porn site.</p><p>And "porn" here includes selfies if they zoom in too closely on the wrong areas.</p><p>With that, many people’s early morning Twitter scroll might contain more explicit material than OnlyFans creators can now offer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Of course, that depends upon whom they follow.</p><p>But while this is an inconvenience for customers, this is a travesty for sex workers who made the site a success.</p><p>OnlyFans processed billions of dollars (keeping 20% of all earnings), and now it’s discarding countless people from safe, reliable work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Last week, we reported on the downright sinister forces at play who made this ban a reality.</p><p>MasterCard implemented new rules recently that required obscenely difficult new standards for any adult content.</p><p>And the malefactors who lobbied for that consider this to be a victory.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Ultimately, as we outlined in our reporting last week, this puritanical Thanos-snap on horny content was deliberately caused.</p><p>For some time, Christian dominionists engaged in a culture war have been using "sex trafficking" hysteria as a wedge issue.</p><p>In many ways, it’s the new "Satanic panic."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When we refer to Christian dominionists, we’re not talking about most American Christians.</p><p>We’re talking about people who want everyone’s laws defined by their theology.</p><p>Exodus Cry and the so-called National Center on Sexual Exploitation are two of the tools in their armory used to target sites like OnlyFans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Both Exodus Cry and NCOSE have been characterized as anti-sex worker hate groups, and with good reason.</p><p>There is no way to advocate against someone’s entire way of life and source of income and also support those people.</p><p>Paradoxically, these groups and others sometimes claim to be crusading for "women’s rights" … by seeking to infringe upon the bodily autonomy of countless women.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Before this, Exodus Cry is believed to have been responsible for PornHub purging massive amounts of content.</p><p>The claim at the time that circulated among anti-sex worker groups was that "most" of the site’s content was suspect or illegal.</p><p>While that was not true, all non-verified users of the porn streaming site were suddenly iced out, leaving mostly large studios behind.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>OnlyFans has been a godsend for countless sex workers, but new and old, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>We’re talking about a source of stable income where content creators can work from home and generate revenue to feed their families and pay bills.</p><p>Trans and disabled content creators found OnlyFans particularly appealing because many other lines of work can involve discrimination and accessibility issues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>There is one silver lining to this grim story: the publicity is not going the way that the malicious puppetmasters intended.</p><p>When PornHub was purged, many uncritically echoed the sentiment that PornHub was pretty sketchy to begin with (true) and that the purge was necessary (not so true).</p><p>This time, the overwhelming majority of the media coverage of the OnlyFans purge has been pro-sex worker.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The goons at anti-sex worker hate groups clearly did not expect the finger-pointing to so quickly identify them and MasterCard, or to so loudly condemn this.</p><p>This is a nightmare for so many content creators, who will now have to find new sites in order to continue working.</p><p>While many hope that OnlyFans’ financial value will crash and burn as it richly deserves, there are countless creators on the site who are scrambling for new work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>For now, we as individuals can support sex workers individually in some cases, but that doesn’t solve the problem.</p><p>Unmasking and exposing these groups in our midst that exist only to lobby to make the world a worse place has to be a priority.</p><p>Anti-sex worker hate groups have lobbied card companies, the DOJ, and more. It’s time for people with power to stop listening to the bad guys.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2WFcLvNpbCfmZ6oeq%2B%2FxbBkm5meYra1v4yspmalpZi1bsPOq6qeZaSdrq952KisZqyYpMKotNNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
