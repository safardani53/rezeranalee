The talk show host slammed the Canadian singer after her recent comments caused major controversy online.&nbsp;“I don’t care who you vote for. I don’t buy that it caught her off guard, and I don’t buy her apology. I think that stars need to stay away from politics so you can keep the coins going at your concerts,” Wendy said during “Hot Topics” on April 23. “I do think that comment she made she will rub people the wrong way, and ticket sales might suffer. You’re in in our country right now trying to sell tickets and you’re talking … just sing!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Shania was slammed by angry fans on April 22, far before Wendy went in on her. Many argued that since Shania is Canadian, her comments were extremely disrespectful because Trump has verbally attacked Canada on multiple occasions. Not to mention, Trump’s policies, some of which involve steel, aluminum tariffs, have put a strain on U.S. relations with Canada — one of America’s top international trading partners.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“I would have voted for him because, even though he was offensive, he seemed honest,” The Guardian quoted Shania saying on April 22. She explained: “Do you want straight or polite? Not that you shouldn’t be able to have both. If I were voting, I just don’t want bullsh-t. I would have voted for a feeling that it was transparent. And politics has a reputation of not being that, right?”</p><p>The immediate backlash forced Shania to release a long apology on the same day of the interview’s release. The country star tweeted a four-part apology, saying she did not “hold any common moral beliefs” with Trump, adding that she was “caught off guard” by the question. Read her full apology below.</p><p>“I would like to apologise to anybody I have offended in a recent interview with the Guardian relating to the American President. The question caught me off guard. As a Canadian, I regret answering this unexpected question without giving my response more context.”</p><p>“I am passionately against discrimination of any kind and hope it’s clear from the choices I have made, and the people I stand with, that I do not hold any common moral beliefs with the current President.”</p><p>“I was trying to explain, in response to a question about the election, that my limited understanding was that the President talked to a portion of America like an accessible person they could relate to, as he was NOT a politician.”</p><p>“My answer was awkward, but certainly should not be taken as representative of my values nor does it mean I endorse him. I make music to bring people together. My path will always be one of inclusivity, as my history shows.”</p><p>Shania has remained away from the spotlight for the most part, after taking a 15-year break from releasing an album. She’s battled issues with her voice, having lost it once. Shania recently underwent laryngoplasty surgery to help reconstruct her vocal box after being bitten by a tick and contracting Lyme disease.</p><p>In her memoir From This Moment On&nbsp;[2012], Shania opened up about her “abusive” and poor childhood for the first time. She also revealed after&nbsp;her parents were killed in a car accident in 1987, she was left her to raise her three younger siblings. Fans remembered Shania’s heartfelt story when they slammed her online, questioning why she would “go against Canada” after it was Canada who had helped her when she needed it most.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH11e5FsZrCdnpnGbsPIpaOimZ2oerS4wKaqZquYlruqrYytrpqhnmLDsMDIp55mnJ%2Bjrq2wjK2prqWgYravwMSrraKdp2KusbvLqJ6yZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
