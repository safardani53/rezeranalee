She wrote about her gratitude and love for her baby girl on Twitter on the holiday. “I found everything i was ever searching for when I became a mother. So grateful for that profound, deep love and honored to join the mama club. Happiest Mother’s Day,” her tweet read.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Orlando also posted a Mother’s Day post in honor of Katy. “Got myself a real catch. 🐠 ❤️,” he wrote alongside a photoshopped pic of his wife-to-be as a mermaid. “Sending love and respect to all the amazing people who have shaped our lives, supported us and loved us unconditionally. Happy Mother’s Day.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Katy-Perry-baby-daisy-beach-day-mega-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>When Katy and Orlando are not making headlines for posts related to their daughter, they’re doing so with their relationship status. <strong>Bobby Bones</strong> recently hinted that the lovebirds may already be married even though neither of them have confirmed it. “It was so small that I did not get that invite,” he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>told </a>Us Weekly&nbsp;in an interview that was shared on May 18. “I did not go to the wedding. And I understood why, although I was jealous.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Katy was spotted wearing <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a gold ring</a> in Mar. but it’s unclear whether or not it was a wedding band.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH12e5FyZqSZpK56sbHRq7Bmp6Khrq%2BwzmaZpaefonqlrdSgn62domKxorXSsmSdp6aaeqe10ayrZqyfpMGpecinq56qpp6yuHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
