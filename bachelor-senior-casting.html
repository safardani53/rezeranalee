Maybe the new Bachelor senior show will bring back casting people who are only there for the right reason: to find love. We cannot wait for the new series and for the quirky new personalities our grandparents may get to fall in love with once we submit them to the casting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/4Jfz-QDHQ/0x0/bachelor-senior-1614718350590.jpg><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The new Bachelor senior show is officially casting, but the show is not totally greenlit.</h2><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ABC website</u></a>, “The Producers of The Bachelor are looking for active and outgoing single men and women IN THEIR GOLDEN YEARS for a new exciting dating show!” And it’s really very easy to apply. Applicants must be 65+ and legal U.S. residents, and of course “ready for a committed relationship.” If that sounds like you or your family member, you can apply at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SeniorDatingShow.CastingCrane.com</u></a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The application consists of questions about the applicant, such as their hobbies, their job, and then of course their relationships. Since senior citizens may have a much longer relationship history than typical Bachelor contestants, we will likely see many divorcees and widows. The application also asks if the applicant has grandkids, which may mean they could be featured on the show somehow.</p><p>However, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Oprah Mag</u><u>,</u></a> ABC will only move forward with production once the show has been cast. But executive Rob Mills doesn’t seem too concerned. In an interview with Variety, he shared, “I have to say, we had never seen a response like we’d seen here.”&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There’s definitely a demand and a niche for a Bachelor senior show.</h2><p>When they originally interviewed potential contestants during the initial pre-pandemic casting, Rob found something really special:</p>“Some of the casting interviews we got, they were just so touching… It’s such a different way of doing ‘The Bachelor’ because these people are just at a totally different place in their lives. There is an interesting thing about people who have hit the other end of the spectrum, who’ve lived their lives, they’ve raised their kids, some have been widowed or divorced and maybe some have never been in love. We thought that would be an interesting dynamic through the ‘Bachelor’ prism.”<p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hi everyone, meet leonard of dating around: the awesome ex-public interest lawyer and widower who once dabbled in LSD, having the cutest dates 😌 im just all smiles and tears for this episode <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Kk91H4i8Iu</a></p>— Astari (@catgacha) <a href=#>August 3, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Plus, in 2019, Netflix released their show, Dating Around, which was a dating show which featured six New Yorkers going on dinner dates with strangers.
