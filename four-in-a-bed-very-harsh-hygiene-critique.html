It was the third visit of the week on the Channel 4 contest and three sets of guests - Jana and Emily, Charlotte and Donna as well as Karlie - all headed to Rob's Wolds Wine Estate.
Rob thought he had the winning trick to make his visit tick all the right boxes thanks to a highly unique addition - his precious vineyard."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Everyone uses different ones for a starter…" [sic].</p><p>Whilst one viewer claimed to always take their own, writing: "I always take my own #fourinabed."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Four in a Bed airs weekdays at 5pm on Channel 4 and All4.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGphbYV4gpBsZp%2Bnpad6qrqMmmSbnZRiw6a%2B2GafmqqjnXqpxcainKedXZi%2FqsDIqqyeZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
