She was also staring at the ring that Aiden gave her when he proposed. Is Emily having second thoughts? Nolan (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gabriel Mann</strong></a>) stopped by with coffee and told her that it would take time to find out what “TWM” meant in the letter.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Daniel (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Joshua Bowman</strong></a>) was busy trying to pump up Charlotte&nbsp;(<strong>Christa B. Allen</strong>) about going after Emily. Daniel wanted to get back at Emily by going after her friends, but Charlotte agreed only if Jack (<strong>Nick Weschler</strong>) wasn’t a target.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Earlier in the episode, Victoria (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Madeleine Stowe</strong></a>) strutted her stuff into Pascal’s (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Olivier Martinez</strong></a>) office to tell him his attempts to woo her were for naught because she couldn’t be bought. Later, Conrad (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Henry Czerny</strong></a>) watched Pascal mull over his failed attempt with Victoria. Conrad told him to relax and that they’d both get what they want, eventually.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Victoria’s group of girlfriends, aka the real housewives of the Hamptons, sat around discussing Pascal and Emily’s fake pregnancy. Victoria told them all to keep a watch out for Emily. “Anyone who is an enemy of yours is not long for this world,” said a fellow Hamtonite. (Well said.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Emily took a day trip to find Aiden in Bermuda. She believed he could have some intel on the letter (and boy, would he.) She even opened up enough to say she missed him, but he was still angry at her and ripped up the letter!</p><h3>‘Revenge’ Recap: In The Name Of Love?</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Margaux (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Karine Vanasse</strong></a>) was offered a magazine job in Rome, but was hesitant to leave Jack. The always noble Jack told her to seriously consider the offer. If she took the job, they would work on a long distance relationship. (Bless him.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Margaux went to Daniel to discuss her offer. Daniel’s inflated ego was at an all-time high this episode. He told Margaux that he didn’t expect her to give up so quickly. Margaux was solely focused on stepping out from her father’s shadow, but Daniel had other plans. He started to plant seeds in Margaux’s head about Jack and Emily. He said that Jack was pushing her out to be closer to Emily. Margaux called him out, but Daniel’s work there was done.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Emily made her daily rounds to find out information and this time, met up with Stevie (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gail O’Grady</strong></a>). She wanted to discuss Pascal. Stevie revealed that Pascal dated Victoria first. Then, Jack stopped by with Carl, and it was the cutest, but not the best timing. Jack asked Emily if she was okay after the fake pregnancy revelation and Aiden was mentioned. She told him that she broke things off with Aiden, even though she still loved him. Jack tried to convince Emily that she needed to tell Aiden how she felt. He held Emily’s hand and Margaux managed to catch a glimpse!</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>According to Stevie, Conrad wasn’t the worst husband back in the day. The news about Jack hit Conrad more than he expected. At first, Stevie was baffled that Conrad seemed to make the whole situation about him, but after some heated discussion, Stevie realized he wasn’t totally in the wrong. Conrad had wanted to make it work with Stevie. Stevie had wanted the same thing, but by the time she was sober, Victoria had snatched him up. She owned up to the fact that she drove Conrad away. Since they were on such good terms, Stevie even offered up Victoria’s trump card!</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Later in the evening, Stevie chatted with Jack about her conversation with Conrad. She seemed a bit on edge. Upon leaving, she poured a drink at the bar and almost took a sip. Jack watched her throw her drink away, but stayed hidden.&nbsp;We hope Stevie stays strong and doesn’t head down the wrong path!</p><h3>‘Revenge’ Recap: Calling Bluffs</h3><p id=content-paragraph-12>It’s Monte Carlo night in the Hamptons, and we all know that any big party does not end in celebration in this town. After some scheming, Emily managed to get Pascal to agree to have his charity involved.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Daniel showed up, even though he wasn’t on the guest list. He was only attending to see the wreck Emily had become. He asked where she got the money to have the party and she said she used his credit card, and handed it right to him! (Go Emily!) But Emily was really concerned with talking to Pascal. She got ready to pounce, but Victoria stole him away. Victoria told Pascal not to trust Emily. Emily stepped in and wanted to play a hand of poker with Pascal, but he switched things up with pitting Victoria and Emily against each other! (This should be good.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>The new guy Javier (<strong>Henri Esteve</strong>) started flirting with Charlotte. He was upfront about his prison days and Charlotte was delighted with his honesty. Nolan pulled him away to warn him about Charlotte, but before Javier left, he planted a hot kiss on Charlotte! Scratch that, it was pretty much a full-on make out session. Love interest alert?</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Jack showed up to the party — looking extra fine — and spotted Margaux. Margaux admitted that Pascal had given Voulez back to her. She also told him about her new plans with Daniel and Jack was wary. Margaux then pulled the jealous girlfriend card and played it extremely well. But since Jack is the best guy anyone could ever have, she quickly forgot about her jealous tendencies.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Victoria and Emily went head-to-head and it was glorious. Victoria played an obscene amount of money and said Emily couldn’t measure up. Emily, however, used Daniel’s engagement ring to match. Emily won this round, but Victoria seemed to have other tricks up her sleeve.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Since Emily won, Pascal agreed to meet with her. He believed her motives were falsely-motivated. She unveiled that her short-lived marriage to Daniel provided her with the Graysons darkest secrets. Her ultimate goal was to gain Pascal as an ally and he agreed. But then, Emily realized she was being bugged and bolted.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>As always, Victoria was following closely behind Emily. The trump card that Stevie had given Conrad was handed over to Pascal, which he gave to Victoria. She admitted she was hunting Emily and her next moves. He apologized for all his wrongdoings and promised never to betray her again. Victoria was willing to give Pascal another chance and they kissed!</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Emily realized Pascal was working with Victoria. She had apparently been taking Victoria Grayson 101 for years and had studied her face. She knew she faulted her winning hand. But Nolan was fresh out of ideas for what to do next.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>However, Aiden returned with shocking news that would catapult them all into their next move. He knew the meaning behind “TWM”(from the latter) because it was the initials of his father,<strong> Trevor Warren Mathis</strong>. (Bomb dropped.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-21><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what did you think of tonight’s Revenge? How is Aiden’s father involved with Emily’s father’s takedown? Do you like Javier? Will Stevie fall off the wagon? Let us know what you think!</p><p id=content-paragraph-22><strong>— Avery Thompson</strong><br><a class=twitter-follow-button href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Follow @avery__thompson</a></p><h3>More ‘Revenge’ News:</h3><li><a href=#>‘Revenge’ Recap: Emily Uncovers Her Next Target</a></li><li><a href=#>‘Revenge’: The Truth Behind Patrick’s Departure and Jack & Emily’s Romance</a></li><li>‘Revenge’ Recap: A Popular Character Leaves The Hamptons Behind</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlkZH10e5JqZqudppq7qLGMq5ycmaBiwKat0qilZmtdmr2qv86dnGZpZ2KuqrDEp2SrnaSqv6%2B%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
