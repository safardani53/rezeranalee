"Also the Royal Oak Theater in Michigan, due to the segregation of them forcing people to show up with vaccinations ... I am also not doing those shows."</p><p>"I know I’m going to sacrifice a lot of money, but I’m not going to be enslaved to the system or money," the comedian added.</p><p>He continued on to say that getting vaccinated is "a choice" and he doesn't care about what his fans have to say about his decision.</p><p>"If you have anything else to say, I honestly don’t care," Breuer continued.
