Sound Off Here!</h3><h3>Intervention Impossible</h3><p id=content-paragraph-2>The madness began when Ezra convinced Aria — out of the goodness of his heart, of course — that Spencer (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Troian Bellisario</strong></a>) has herself a wee little drug problem. He was right, to be fair, but that doesn’t change the fact that he’s as evil as he is gorgeous. In fact, bringing Spencer’s addiction to light was merely a ploy to distract the girls from the real issue at hand.<strong><br></strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Hanna (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ashley Benson</strong></a>), Emily (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Shay Mitchell</strong></a>) and Aria ambushed Spencer at her house, and while I enjoyed the dramatic scene — it was like the world’s most glamorous episode of&nbsp;Intervention&nbsp;— it frustrated me that the girls, specifically Aria, refused to listen to Spencer because of her addiction. Why can’t they just accept that she’s the smart one and believe everything she says? Ugh.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Part two of Ezra’s plan was reaching out to Mona (<strong>Janel Parrish</strong>) for support, only&nbsp;that&nbsp;didn’t work out quite like he’d hoped. Maybe if he hadn’t interrupted Mona on her date with Mike (<strong>Cody Christian</strong>), she’d have been more willing to help him! You’d think “A” would know not to c**k-block by now. Sheesh!<strong><br></strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>I’m pretty sure Mona eventually had a change of heart and agreed to pose as Alison (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sasha Pieterse</strong></a>) to freak out the girls at the zoo, but honestly, you just never know with this show.</p><h3>Aria Finally Unravels Ezra’s Lies</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>Fortunately, Aria began to see through Ezra’s lies as soon as he started talking about the time Spencer thought she saw Toby (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Keegan Allen</strong></a>) in the woods, revealing details that only “A” would know.<strong><br></strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Unfortunately for Spencer, Mama Hastings (<strong>Lesley Fera</strong>) caught wind of her addiction — the doctor’s office returned “her” call about refilling Spencer’s prescription — and it was basically “game over” from that point on.<strong><br></strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The jig was&nbsp;truly&nbsp;up for Ezra when Aria broke into his cabin and found some of his secret writings, ones that described his past with Alison. This led to a very stressful chase through the woods — I’m still having heart palpitations, to be honest — and culminated in one of the most intense face-offs this show has ever delivered.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Conveniently trapped on a broken lift machine, Ezra managed to convince Aria — poor, foolish Aria — that he was writing a “true crime” book about Alison. He did admit that he took his job at Rosewood High and pursued his relationship with Aria for the sake of his book, but he claimed his feelings for her are still real.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>And while I’m inclined to assume everything that comes out of Ezra’s mouth is B.S., creator&nbsp;<strong>Marlene King&nbsp;</strong>tells <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! Online</a> that’s not the case. She says that not only is Ezra not “A,” but he’s&nbsp;never&nbsp;been “A.”&nbsp;Um… am I the only one who feels cheated right now? I’m getting a little tired of being told someone is a villain, only to have the show completely backtrack and waste my time, emotions, etc.</p><h3>Spencer, Interrupted</h3><p id=content-paragraph-11>The episode ended with Spencer’s mom confronting her about her problem, clearly at the end of her rope. “I can’t do this again,” she said, vaguely threatening a form of punishment I can’t even imagine at this point.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>So, basically, Hanna and Emily are the only liars whose lives aren’t completely upside down at this point. Terrific.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what did you think of this insane hour? Do you think Aria is really over Ezra for good? Will Spencer’s addiction keep people from believing her? And was that Mona or Ali at the zoo?
