The celebrity couple, who wed themselves in July 2015, challenged a selection of Lindsay’s suitors to complete a “husbandry” obstacle course. The men notably struggled to change a diaper, strap a baby doll into a Baby Björn, vacuum the ground and set a table. While<a href=#><strong> Lucas Yancey</strong></a> — known for<a href=#> his “WhaBoom”&nbsp;&nbsp;catchphrase</a> — ultimately won the challenge, Kutcher was not impressed.</p><p class=p1>“I was like, ‘None of these,’” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Ranch&nbsp;</i></a>alum recalled to Witherspoon, 46, during the Thursday interview. “You know why?

Obviously, we were engaged for a couple years. Now, we’ve been married for a couple years. We have a new house, <a href=#>we have our dogs [Copper and Brownie]</a>, kids are in our future as well. We just got a lot of great things going on. Our careers are flourishing, we’re both in a good place.”</p><p class=p2>He continued at the time: “We can’t lose sight of why we came together in the first place and that was love, right? So we planned dates. Even if it’s just the most basic thing, just as far as we’re spending quality time together, I think that’s what matters. The pastor [who] actually performed at our wedding, <a href=#>we did premarital counseling</a> with him and he mentioned that it was so important for you to date your partner, always pursue your partner and set time aside to have those quality intimate moments with each other where you can grow as a couple.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarmZOdsq15y6KlnauRrnqqv4yipZ2dkqmypXnTqGSaq5ipvK95yq6rnKCVp3qnu9FmmauxkaN6rq3Rq6Can5Vk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
