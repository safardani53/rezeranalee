She completed her look with a Diamant chain necklace and a slicked-back ponytail.</p><p class=p3>Underneath the jaw-dropping jacket, Cardi opted for a black bustier pantabodysuit, Rock Stud earrings and a Diamant Typo ring. For glam, she went dark with a winged eye and smoky lids, which complemented her purple lips.</p><p class=p3>The runway was an exciting albeit exhausting moment for Cardi.</p><p class=p3>“When I tell y’all I feel like I’m dying. Can y’all believe this? The voice that I had all day [is gone],” she quipped in an Instagram Story later on Saturday night. “But I pushed through! A bitch pushed through, y’all.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Cardi-B-Shuts-Down-Catwalk-at-Balenciaga-Fall-Runway-Show-in-Oversize-Blue-Fur-Coat.jpg><p class=p3>Cardi continued: “I need to stop talking because I need my voice. I gotta record. I feel like s—t, but I’m a trooper.”</p><p class=p3>Saturday’s runway performance marked Cardi’s first time on the catwalk, though <a href=#>she previously appeared</a> in the brand’s fashion campaigns. She became the face of Balenciaga in 2020 one year before her husband, <strong>Offset</strong>, made his runway debut with the brand.</p><p class=p3>“Popped out to the s/s 22 @balenciaga show! So proud of my husband @offsetyrn who walked the show!” Cardi <a href=#>wrote via Instagram in October 2021</a> of Offset’s surprise appearance at the Paris show. “Thank you [<strong>Demna</strong>, the creative director] and the Balenciaga team for your hospitality! I had such an amazing experience.”</p><p class=p3>Cardi and Offset, 31, got married in 2018 and <a href=#>they share two kids</a>: Kulture, 5, and Wave, 2. (Offset also has three older children from past relationships.)</p><p class=p3>Just like <a href=#>their fashion-forward parents</a>, Cardi and Offsett’s blended brood have their own tastes.</p><p class=p3>“She has a lot of dresses. She already has this attitude about herself where she already knows how to walk like a model and she takes it seriously,” Offset gushed of Kulture<a href=#> in an October TikTok video for UGG</a>. “She always wants to show me, ‘Daddy look what I put together, look at this scarf I put on …’ I feel like she can dress herself.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3>The married couple even gifted Kulture<a href=#> a miniature Birkin bag</a> for her latest birthday. Their sons, however, have a different relationship to fashion.</p><p class=p3>“I remember this one time I was gonna buy Wave a hat and Offset was like ‘No,’” Cardi added in the social media clip. “Whatever. I am trying! … All the kids got different styles — literally.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5ius7DIZplmq5iqwbR5w6iup2WSlrmmusKimKCZXZiutcPApaJmoZ5ivLex0aygs51dm662xIyfrKtlk6SutXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
