He began his radio career in 1969, working on the L.A.-based radio show KNAC and then headed over to 95.5 KLOS. Eventually, Ladd moved to another L.A. show, KMET-FM, where he assisted the station’s rise as a top-rated L.A. station. He remained at KMET until 1987.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During his time at KMET, he created, produced, and hosted the radio program Innerview, in which he conducted interviews with acclaimed musicians. The program then aired every week on over 160 stations and concluded after a 12-year run.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Jim Ladd on December 14, 2014 in Agoura Hills, California.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Scott Dudelson/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ladd returned to KLOS in 1997 for another 14 years. He left to host his SiriusXM's “Deep Tracks" in 2012. The channel features tracks from lesser-known music groups.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout his career, Ladd also made cameos in a few movies, including Tequila Sunrise and Say Anything. He wrote a book in 1991, Radio Waves: Life And Revolution On The FM Dial, which was inspired by his radio career up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A decade later, Ladd served as inspiration for Tom Petty’s track “The Last DJ,” the title track to his 2002 album with The Heartbreakers. The “Free Fallin’” singer told journalist Jim DeRogatis that the song was about “a DJ who becomes so frustrated with his inability to play what he wants that he moves to Mexico and gets his freedom back,” reports <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Billboard</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2005, Ladd received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame honoring his impact within the music industry and radio medium.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Jim Ladd receives his Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Hollywood, California.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jeffrey Mayer/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow> PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Several musicians shared tributes to Ladd.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The Doors family is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of beloved rock DJ, Jim Ladd, who died of a sudden heart attack peacefully at home with his wife Helene at his side.
