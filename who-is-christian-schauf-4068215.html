News</a>.&nbsp;The former&nbsp;Real Housewives of Orange County star, 35, has not confirmed the romance reports. Here’s five quick facts about Christian:</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>1.</strong> <b>Christian Schauf is an entrepreneur, athlete and philanthropist&nbsp; from Wisconsin. </b>— Although he grew up on a farm in Wisconsin, he currently resides in Utah. Christian’s “a serial adventurer,” who in his downtime, “lends aid to those in need, performs charity work in the world’s most dangerous cities, and chases adventure in every sense of the word,” his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a> states in a description about him.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>2. Christian is a business owner.</strong> — He’s the founder of Uncharted Supply Company, which sells emergency preparedness kit. Christian actually appeared on Shark Tank with the product. (The description mentioned in No. 2 is from the supply company’s website.) Christian started the company “after driving through Colorado in the middle of a blizzard and seeing dozens of hapless motorists stranded on the side of the highway, hunkering down for a long, cold night,” the website explains. “Though rescue teams were surely on the way, they were at the mercy of Mother Nature until those teams arrived.” — That’s when he created a (expert-tested and expert approved) “72-hour survival kit that anybody could use in the event of a dangerous situation.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/meghan-king-edmonds-christian-schauf-5-things-rex-embed.jpg alt="Meghan King Edmonds & Jim Edmonds & their kids " width=620 height=442 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Meghan King and Jim Edmonds posing with their twin boys, Hart and Hayes, born on June 5, 2018.
