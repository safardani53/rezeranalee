The pair went to the Met Gala in September 2021, but they walked the carpet separately. Zoë dazzled in a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sheer metal mesh dress</a> by Yves Saint Laurent. Her nearly naked dress was one of the hottest looks of the night.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>They didn’t walk in together, but they left together. Channing and Zoë were seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>walking down the steps</a> of the Met together after the event. They made their way out onto the street before leaving costume’s biggest night.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>For months now, fans have been wondering when these two would go Instagram official. Before the Met Gala, Zoë and Channing were seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>going out to lunch</a> in New York City. The month before in August 2021, Channing took <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Zoë on a bike ride</a> in the East Village. Fans thought Channing confirmed his relationship with Zoë when he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>followed fan pages</a> dedicated to Zoë in August 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zoe-kravitz-channing-tatum-halloween-2021-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Zoë and actor <strong>Karl Glusman</strong> were married in 2019 but split in 2020.
