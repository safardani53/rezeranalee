The “No Lie” hitmaker and Kesha are still so in love as they come upon their four-year wedding anniversary in a few months. Below, find out more about Kesha, who also goes by Nakesha, and her fairytale romance with her famous husband.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2-chainz-kesha-ward-ss-embed1.jpg><h3><b><strong><i>Kesha is a&nbsp;</i><span><span><i>businesswoman</i></span></span><i>&nbsp;& philanthropist.</i></strong></b></h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>Kesha is not in the music industry like her husband, but she’s still extremely successful and hardworking. Since September 2016, she’s been the owner of A Gift From Heaven, a preschool and childcare facility located in Atlanta, according to her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn</a>. Kesha is also the founder of the TRU Foundation, a non-profit that offers support to the African American community in Atlanta. Lastly, she’s the CEO and founder of Bouncing with Harmony LLC, a recreation and entertainment establishment located in Atlanta. Kesha got her Bachelor’s degree in criminal justice and corrections at Alabama State University in 2002, per her LinkedIn.</p><h3><b><strong><i>She and 2 Chainz share three children.</i></strong></b></h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>Kesha is the mother of 2 Chainz’s three children. They have daughters <strong>Heaven,</strong> born July 26, 2008, and <strong>Harmony</strong>, born October 20, 2012, plus son&nbsp;<strong>Halo</strong>, born October 14, 2015. All three kids were born before the couple got married. &nbsp;Kesha shares glimpses of their family to her 83,000 followers on Instagram. She recently <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared a snapshot</a> of the family of five posing with the caption, “The Epps.”</p><h3><b><strong><i>She was proposed to twice.</i></strong></b></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2-chainz-kesha-ward-ss-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>The first time that 2 Chainz proposed to Kesha was at the BET Awards in June 2013. However, they didn’t go through with the wedding due to their busy schedules with work and raising the kids. So on May 7, 2018, the rapper shocked everyone — including Kesha — when he proposed at the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Met Gala</a>. 2 Chainz got down on one knee on the red carpet in New York City and pulled out a massive diamond ring. Kesha, with tears in her eyes, happily accepted her beau’s second proposal. “It’s crazy, he just gave me this! So happy! I love it,” she told E! News after the romantic moment.</p><h3><b><strong><i>Her wedding was an&nbsp;</i><span><span><i>extravagant</i></span></span><i>&nbsp;affair.</i></strong></b></h3><p id=content-paragraph-8>2 Chainz and Kesha’s <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wedding</a> took place at the Gianni&nbsp;Versace Mansion in Miami on August 18, 2018, just a few months after the Met Gala proposal. It was definitely a day to remember, thanks in part to the white Bengal tiger in a cage that shockingly showed up to the venue with a caretaker shortly before the elaborate ceremony. Yep, extravagant for sure.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Kesha walked down the aisle in a mermaid wedding dress to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>John Legend</strong></a>‘s “All of Me.” For the reception, she wore a gorgeous red gown, while 2 Chainz rocked a gold blazer. The star-studded guest list included <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> and then-husband <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lil Wayne</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Alicia Keys</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Swizz Beatz</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gucci Mane</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme5FmmqGZmaPHbsPIn5xmo5WotaJ51pqpnWVkbH9xhJZwZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
