I think that’s all you can ask for in a Bachelorette — someone that has had hurts in their life and has been in love before, who knows what it’s like and yearns for that but doesn’t need that. I didn’t need it. I wanted it and that’s why I knew it was right for me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH14e5JpZqGZnqOuqXnBq6awpl2ptaZ5wZqaoZ2cpL%2BmwNOeZJ%2Bhnpa5pnnRqKqeZZOav6a5zqewZqiYpMGwv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
