Whether she’s walking the streets of New York, strutting down a runway or red carpet, she always delivers an unforgettable fashion moment.
When asked to describe her personal style, the England native told Vogue France in 2019 that her aesthetic “is a little retro.” She added: “I’m very into Princess Diana right now — so a little 1980s, some menswear mixed in with a little biker short, or something really feminine."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

When it comes to fashion, the supermodel just gets it.</p><p>Whether she’s walking the streets of New York, strutting down a runway or red carpet, she always delivers an unforgettable fashion moment.</p><p>When asked to describe her personal style, the England native told <a href=#>Vogue France</a> in 2019 that her aesthetic “is a little retro.” She added: “I’m very into <a href=#>Princess Diana</a> right now — so a little 1980s, some menswear mixed in with a little biker short, or something really feminine.”</p><p>In March 2022, the <a href=#>My Body</a> author was photographed walking her dog in Soho, wearing a two-toned, loose-fitting blazer teamed with slouchy leather pants and pointed toe black boots. Ratajkowski accessorized with a black baseball cap and a pair of square-shaped sunglasses.</p><p>When she’s not slaying off duty, the We Are Your Friends star serves Us with dramatic red carpet moments. At the <a href=#>2022 Met Gala</a>, Ratajkowski offered her interpretation of Gilded Glamour in a vibrant archival ensemble from Versace. The 1992 piece featured a see-through beaded top, which was teamed with a colorful high-low skirt. She completed the look with an effortless updo and soft makeup.</p><p>Skin-baring looks are a go-to for the actress. In November 2021, Ratajkowski brought back the low-rise trend at the<a href=#> CFDA Fashion Awards</a> when she stepped out in a gray ribbed zip-up cropped sweater and a pleated midi skirt from Miu Miu. On her feet, Ratajkowski opted for preppy pumps — also from the Italian fashion house.</p><p>For those that don’t know, Ratajkowski is also a force in fashion behind the scenes. In 2017, the Gone Girl star launched her clothing line Inamorata. The label first <a href=#>debuted with swimwear</a>, but now includes loungewear, dresses and jewelry.</p><p>In 2019, Ratajkowski opened up about her brand, explaining in an interview with <a href=#>Elle </a>that she wanted to fill a void in the fashion industry.</p><p>“Swim has always been fun. I was always a girl who collected a million bathing suits, and I didn’t have a go-to swimwear company, and I didn’t have a go-to underwear company,” she said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She added: “For me, that’s huge. You know, even just the basic slip dresses, those are harder to find than you would think. I don’t want it to be a brand where you’re like ‘Oh, wow. I got this one thing, and then they never made it again.’ I want it to be the kind of thing where girls are like, ‘Oh, yeah. Inamorata, perfect. I can get that comfy cotton set.’ You know?”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Ratajkowski’s all-time best fashion moments:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvEpqClsV2nrrWtyaSmsKubnsBursSsq2aekai1qrvNZqSopZWjwbR5zp9kmqScYsGqucRmp6GnpKTAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
