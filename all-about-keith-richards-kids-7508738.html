Aside from being an iconic rock star, Keith is also a proud father to his five children: Marlon, Angela, Tara, Theodora and Alexandra.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the 1970s, Keith welcomed his first three kids with model <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Anita Pallenberg</a>: sons Marlon and Tara and daughter Angela. A few years after his relationship with Pallenberg ended, Keith married model <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Patti Hansen</a> and the couple welcomed two daughters: Theodora and Alexandra.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I don’t care how cool and hip and whatever you think you are. You get down the line, baby, what counts is family,” he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>GQ</a> in 2015. “This is what I did it for.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keith hasn’t spoken extensively about his children, but some are more drawn to the spotlight than others. His oldest kids, Marlon and Angela, live more private lives, while his youngest ones, Theodora and Alexandra, are the most well-known, having pursued careers in the entertainment industry. Unfortunately, his son, Tara, died at just 2 months old.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I love my families,” Keith told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Daily Mail</a> in 2010. “I have several — extended. And they all love each other. I’m extremely blessed with my ladies who all, thank God, get along.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In December 2022, Keith and Hansen celebrated 39 years of marriage. Theodora wrote about their love in a post on her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a>: “I am so proud of this family. We’ve been through a lot but the love is so strong and powerful that it carries us forever forward on a cloud of compassion and courage. I love you mom and dad. You guys are my inspiration.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s everything to know about Keith Richards’ children: Marlon, Angela, Tara, Theodora and Alexandra.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-marlon-leon-sundeep-richards-54></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Marlon Leon Sundeep Richards, 54</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Keith Richards and Anita Pallenberg's son Marlon Leon Sundeep Richards in December 2017.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Darren Gerrish/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keith and Pallenberg’s older son, Marlon Leon Sundeep Richards, was born on Aug. 10, 1969, amid The Rolling Stones’ rise to fame. His upbringing was anything but traditional as he grew up on tour with Keith, Pallenberg and the band.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Of course it was hard on him,” Keith told GQ of Marlon’s childhood. In 2017, Pallenberg spoke about those years with journalist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Alain Elkann</a>. “We were on the road a lot, traveling on tour, and I took my son everywhere,” she said. “I did not send Marlon to school until he was 8 years old. I taught him how to read and write while Keith’s mother looked after my daughter.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1992, Marlon met model Lucie de la Falaise on a blind date arranged by Pallenberg, who noticed de la Falaise on the cover of Vogue Italia, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Tatler</a>. The two got married in 1994 and have three children: Ella Rose, Orson and Ida Violet. In 2010, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Daily Mail</a> reported that Marlon lived in a farmhouse in England and worked as a gallery curator, graphic artist and photographer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s amazing what kids can adapt to. It all comes out in the wash,” Keith told GQ. “And anyway, we didn’t really do anything that wrong. I mean, he could have grown up the son of health-nut freaks.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Marlon’s daughter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ella</a> is a model who has been <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>photographed alongside</a> other famous kids, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Kate Moss</a>’ daughter, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Lila Moss</a>. In 2012, Ella told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5>Teen Vogue</a> she shared clothes with her mom, but her father had “some really nice cashmere sweaters” she also liked to borrow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 2014 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Times</a>, Keith spoke about Marlon and reflected on his parenting. “He’s bringing up his own kids in a very secure way, hands-on all the time because he never got that,” he said.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dandelion-angela-richards-51></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Dandelion Angela Richards, 51</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Keith Richards and Anita Pallenberg's daughter Dandelion Angela Richards in September 2011.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>WENN Rights Ltd / Alamy</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keith and Pallenberg’s daughter, Dandelion Angela Richards, was born on April 17, 1972. Her name is Dandelion, but she goes by her middle name, Angela.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Contrary to popular belief, The Rolling Stones’ song “Angie” was not inspired by Angela. In his 2010 autobiography, Life, Keith wrote that the name “Angie” just came to him while he was writing the song. “It was not about any particular person; it was a name, like ohhh, Diana,” he wrote. “I didn’t know Angela was going to be called Angela when I wrote ‘Angie.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Angela married Dominic Jennings in 1998, and the two were together for 15 years before splitting. She later got engaged to her longtime boyfriend, Graham Whitney, in 2020. The couple have two children: a daughter named Ava Melody, born in 2011, and a son named Otto Reed, born in 2014.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keith's second child keeps her life private and doesn’t have a public social media presence. Still, it appears she is close with her siblings. In 2019, Alexandra shared a photo of Angela with a birthday cake and a video of her dancing on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a>. “Cheers to my favorite dancing queen today 🥂 Happy birthday sistah! Love you so,” Alexandra wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Theodora posted another birthday tribute to Angela on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a> in 2023. "You are total star shine✨ Always making everyone smile wherever you go. Your wonderful children mirror your joy and zest for life,” she wrote alongside pictures featuring Keith and Angela with her kids.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tara-jo-jo-gunne-richards></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Tara Jo Jo Gunne Richards</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keith and Pallenberg’s second son, Tara Jo Jo Gunne Richards, was born on March 26, 1976. Tara died of sudden infant death syndrome two months later.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time of Tara’s death, Keith was on tour with The Rolling Stones in Paris. In 2015, he reflected on the loss on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, saying that hearing the news over a phone call was “such a shock.” The musician continued with a scheduled appearance to cope with the event while his family was in Geneva.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I thought, ‘I am going to go mad unless I do this show tonight. If I don’t do something that I am supposed to do, if I just sit here with this idea, I don’t know what I’d do,’ ” Keith said, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Guardian</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In his 2010 autobiography Life, he opened up about his decision to go on tour right after Pallenberg gave birth. “Leaving a newborn is something I can’t forgive myself for. It’s as if I deserted my post,” Keith wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Life co-author James Fox told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rolling Stone</a> that the first time he and Keith spoke about Tara for the book, “Keith couldn’t get out more than five words.” He added, “Then we realized we had to go back to it. He told me he thought about it every week.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-theodora-dupree-richards-38></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Theodora Dupree Richards, 38</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Keith Richards with his daughter Theodora Richards at a New York City event in September 2014.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kevin Mazur/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Theodora Dupree Richards</a> was born on March 18, 1985, two years after Keith and Hansen married. In a 2014 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Harper’s Bazaar</a>, the model said she was named after her great-grandfather, Theodore Augustus Dupree.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout the years, Theodora has revealed insight into her upbringing, revealing how her father's music background influenced what was playing in their home. She joked that when she started to get into <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Justin Timberlake</a>, her dad “had a stink about it.”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was classical music in the morning, reggae in the afternoon and rock ‘n’ roll all night. It was the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Everly Brothers</a>, Anita O’Day, Louis Prima,” she told Harper's Bazaar.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2018, Theodora shared a few childhood photos of herself and her family with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Interview</a> magazine. “I really am super blessed,” she said. “My parents, they stayed together, and I love their love.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Theodora has spent more time in the spotlight than her older siblings. She has modeled for publications like Harper’s Bazaar and British Vogue. She also hosts a monthly SiriusXM show called Off the Cuff, where she interviews some of her favorite rock stars. In 2014, she illustrated Keith's children’s book Gus & Me: The Story of My Granddad and My First Guitar.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also discussed her “eclectic” sense of style in a 2019 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>DuJour</a>. “I like a little bit of everything, from punk rock to elegance and grace,” she said. “When it comes to my style, I can be really colorful and in your face and loud, but it totally depends on my mood.” She added that her dad greatly influenced her style, and she always raided his closet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Theodora doesn’t share much about her personal life, she gives glimpses here and there on her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a> account. She often posts photos with her sister, Alexandra, and nieces and nephews. The model also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>shares pictures</a> of her dog, a French bulldog named Honey.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-alexandra-nicole-richards-37></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Alexandra Nicole Richards, 37</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Keith Richards and Patti Hansen's daughter Alexandra Richards in February 2023.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Michael Tullberg/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keith’s youngest child, Alexandra Nicole Richards, was born on July 28, 1986. Today, she's a DJ and is regularly photographed at events with her famous friends.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite her public life, Alexandra once described herself as “the shyest person,” saying she never really wanted to be in the spotlight. She was raised in a quiet home in Connecticut with Theodora and, in 2019, told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>New York Post</a>, “We had this little house in the woods, and we were so disconnected from the hustle and bustle.” She also described herself as “a family girl.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That said, Alexandra got into modeling at a young age. Her first modeling job was with her sister Theodora for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Tommy Hilfiger</a> when she was 14. Two years later, she started traveling the world and walking runways, but when Alexandra turned 21, she stopped modeling and began to DJ, a skill she learned from her friend E.B. Sollis. After filling in for him one night, the two formed the duo Ebeneezer Wolf Child, and she now performs all over the world.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from her music endeavors, Alexandra is committed to charity work through nonprofits such as Sphere, which helps adults with disabilities, and Project Zero, which works to protect the world’s oceans. “Charities are my passion — they really mean something at the end of the day to me,” she told the New York Post.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While she shares some of her life on Instagram, Alexandra likes to fly under the radar. “I live a very quiet life,” she said. “It’s a scary world, too, so it’s also fear that makes me not want to overly post. But if it’s something very meaningful, I’ll put it out there.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2020, Alexandra told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vogue</a> she met her husband, film director Jacques Naudé, through mutual friends, and they got engaged two years later in Turks and Caicos. They married in the fall of 2019 in a nature-inspired wedding in her parents’ backyard in Connecticut, where the New York-based couple often spend their weekends.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We cook, make fires, create, play games, dance and read,” she said. “It’s pretty relaxing and always fun. I grew up there as well, and ... it was kind of a win that it’s so close for planning purposes too.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In March 2021, Alexandra announced that she was pregnant with her first child in an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram post</a>. Her daughter, Arlowe Mae, was born in May of that year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5GhuW6twaisrWWbmra1tIyroJygkaextHnKopusZWdqfXmDknE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
