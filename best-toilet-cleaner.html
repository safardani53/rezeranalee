Well, HG's ultra-powerful toilet cleaner can make them disappear - and without you needing to scrub, either. It typically takes a few goes with the stuff, and you should leave it in as long as possible before flushing for a result that fans say makes 'loo look like new' and leaves the toilet 'all sparkly and shiny again.'

It helps to prevent limescale build-up (you need to scrub) but also leaves your loo smelling fantastic (and it comes in different scents to appeal to your taste, but Ocean Mist just happens to be Mrs. Hinch's favourite). It's perfect for when you have houseguests over.</p><p class=pdp-description-reviews__content-text>'This is a usual in our house, I have noticed the limescale hasn't built up as much as it used to since using this and it leaves a pleasant subtle smell in the bathroom. It also masks any unpleasant smells left behind too!!' remarks one fan.</p><h2>4.
