For it to be considered bourbon (and not just whiskey), the drink needs to be made with 51% corn. It also has to be aged in a charred oak barrel.

Best cheap bourbon</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/jp-_woodfrodjpg-JS514837728.jpg><p>Woodford Reserve Bourbon is incredibly cheap for the quality it delivers. Great for everyone but particularly people used to drinking Scotch, it trades sweetness for flavours of tobacco spice and dried vanilla, with a warming finish.</p><p>The great flavour should be no surprise, though: the whiskey is made on Kentucky's oldest distillery site. They've had a long time to perfect the recipe.</p><ul><li><strong>(AD) Woodford Reserve Bourbon Whiskey, 70cl, for £25 on Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><h2><strong>2. Best bourbon for beginners</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/jp-_wild_turkeyjpg-JS514837720.jpg><p>The good thing about bourbon is it lacks the pretentiousness found with other drinks. Wild Turkey 101 is a well-made whiskey with a massive sweet kick, with notes of honey, caramel and brown sugar.</p><p>Its high proof (50.5% ABV) means it works incredibly well in cocktails, like an Old Fashioned.</p><ul><li><strong>(AD) Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon Whiskey, 70cl, for £25 on Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><h2><strong>3. Best smooth bourbon</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/jp-_buffjpeg-JS514837723.jpg><p>Buffalo Trace is one of the most balanced of the cheaper bourbons. The whiskey is made from Kentucky and Indiana corn and aged in new American oak barrels. This process gives it equal parts sweet, oak and spice.</p><p>Coming in at 40% ABV, it's won't knock you off your feet like the others. Expect a much more smooth finish.</p><ul><li><strong>Buffalo Trace Bourbon Whiskey, 70cl, for £18 on Tesco -<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> buy here</a></strong></li></ul><h2><strong>4. Best single barrel bourbon</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/jp-_four_rosesjpg-JS514837722.jpg><p>Single barrel whiskey is basically what the name suggests: a drink that's been aged in a single barrel, rather than a blend of multiple. While this is more expensive to create, the bourbon develops a richer taste.</p><p>Four Roses Single Barrel (50% ABV) is a balanced, mellow sweet whiskey, with hints of stone fruits, spices and Morello cherries. The finish is long and delicate.</p><ul><li><strong>(AD) Four Roses Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, 70cl, for £42.01 on Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><h2><strong>5.

Having spent more time in the barrel, this will be less sweet and have a more earthy flavour.</p><p>Expect strong tones of oak, alongside candied almonds and rich cocoa.</p><ul><li><strong>(AD) Eagle Rare 10 Year Old Bourbon Whiskey, 70cl, for £36.49 - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here&nbsp;</a></strong></li></ul><h2><strong>6. Best small batch bourbon</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/jp-_1972jpg-JS514837719.jpg><p>Small batch whiskeys are made for connoisseurs due to their complex palette. They are normally created with a mash bill of under 200 bushels of grain and distilled into quantities of around 1000 gallons.</p><p>The 1792 Small Batch - named after the year Kentucky became a state - is a spicy drink, with a bigger rye profile.</p><ul><li><strong>1792 Small Batch, 75cl, for £35.90 on Master of Malt -<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">POPULAR IN SUN SELECTS FOOD AND DRINK</h2></p><p>Enjoyed our roundup of the best bourbons?
