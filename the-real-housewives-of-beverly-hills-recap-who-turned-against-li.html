That much became abundantly clear on Wednesday’s The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, which picked up in the immediate aftermath of the blowout fight between Kyle Richards and Lisa Vanderpump. 
Kyle met up with Dorit Kemsley, Teddi Mellencamp, Erika Girardi, Denise Richards and Camille Grammer for some drinks. "><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You’re not my f–king friend! You’re not Lisa’s f–king friend! Get out of our house!'”</p><p>“And Lisa said, ‘If you think that I did this on purpose then there’s nothing left to say!'” Kyle added. “She could’ve just said, ‘I’m sorry that you feel like that.’ Anything but this.”</p><p>The ladies were shocked by the way things transpired with Erika complaining about the whole thing.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/camille-grammer-is-angry-750x1024.jpg><p>“That’s not friendship; that’s bullshit.”</p><p>Lisa and Ken were also not ready to let go of the past.&nbsp;</p><p>“What happened with Kyle the other day?” Lisa said. “I don’t think I’ve ever lost it like that in my life before.”</p><p>Ken said Kyle “absolutely knows it doesn’t make sense” and that she wants to cause problems for Lisa.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think I’ve taken quite a lot of crap from Kyle Richards,” Lisa said during a confessional. “Even last year with Nanny K, even saying little things like that. You know, that hurts.”&nbsp;</p><p>As is always the case with Lisa and Ken, they tried to make light of the situation. As such, they made the decision to give their kitchen a facelift.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/lisa-vanderpump-for-season-9-768x1024.jpg><p>“You know what, Ken? This kitchen has this sort of negative vibe to me. And also, with Kyle standing there, I feel like taking a sledgehammer, not to her head, but to this kitchen. Just the whole thing. I want it gone,” Lisa explained to Ken.</p><p>“I don’t want love like that. And I wouldn’t love somebody that I would say preys on the weak, is manipulative, is a liar. Why would you love somebody like that? I would detest them, actually.”</p><p>Lisa admitted that Ken was a bit hard on Kyle, but said that she saw red in when Kyle started bashing him.&nbsp;</p><p>“I could say I’m hurt, I could say I don’t like anything that she did, but I’m not going to stand here and say what a f–king bitch she was,” Lisa said, adding, “Ah! I said it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/lisa-vanderpump-is-sad.jpg><p>Lisa met up with Denise because the pair had not fought as of yet. Lisa did not want to fight with her, and the pair actually got on really well, without touching on the Kyle subject.&nbsp;</p><p>Denise later met up with the rest of the cast, and Camille Grammer was on hand to bash her ex-husband.&nbsp;</p><p>“I planned Camille’s [bridal] shower not knowing that’s where she and Kelsey got married,” Kyle said with a grin.</p><p>“That’s like ancient history,” Camille told Kyle. “I don’t even remember being in bed with the man, for God’s sake! I mean, it’s been that long! Not that it was ever that hot and heavy.”</p><p>“And listen, I’ve learned a lot because of him,” Camille continued. “I was deeply, madly in love with him during our marriage. And at the end, it just petered out.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/camille-grammer-on-a-red-carpet-683x1024.jpg><p>The ladies loved this side of Camille, but things got super awkward when she asked Dorit if she had ever “male-groomed” PK.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m an ex-dental assistant, so it’s hard for me because I was a dental assistant!” Camille said.</p><p>“So I’m really funny about teeth, for real! Oh, God, before Lisa Vanderpump got her teeth redone…”</p><p>The ladies laughed.&nbsp;</p><p>“I had such an issue with the gums!” Camille laughed. “I was like, ‘Honey, you need new caps! Your gum line is receding!’ But now, they look great. At least you can stand her breath!”</p><p>“I’m going down. I’m going down,” Camille continued, knowing she had just bashed her friend.</p><p>She concluded, “Just bring my casket to my wedding. I’ll bring the nine-inch nails. Just put me in it.”</p><p>What did you think of the latest drama?</p><p>Hit the comments below.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RHOBH airs Wednesdays on Bravo.&nbsp;</strong></p><a href=#><img width=1510 height=1161 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/12/the-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-season-9.png alt="The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Season 9" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills: Official Season 9 Portraits!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2WBcMDHnmSrnZGheqm71KycsKGmmsBuu8VmmZ6ulae5unnHoqOlq12nsqStz2auoaddqcKzusSdZJqfkZ67tMCMpaBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
