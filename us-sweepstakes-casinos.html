Over that time, they have developed a lot in terms of their software, accessibility, games and more. With the industry constantly changing and improving, it makes it even more important to be consistent when we‚Äôre ranking our favorite sites.</p><p>In this section, we‚Äôre running through the factors we consider for every single sweeps casino we review.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Sign-up bonuses</h3><p>The welcome bonus is like your first impression of a new social casino, the opportunity to kick off your experience on a positive note. We like to see sites offer both Gold Coins and Sweeps Coins for free when you create an account, so you can start playing in both modes right after registration.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Website UX</h3><p>The quality of software design has improved a lot over the years and it‚Äôs a big factor for us. We look for a smooth and user friendly experience, with no bugs or lags in the software.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>User safety&nbsp;</h3><p>We only ever give our seal of approval to sites that meet the legal requirements for offering sweepstakes games, and have a track record of treating their players safely and fairly.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Customer support</h3><p>We like sweeps casinos that are extremely transparent and go out of their way to explain how the model works, especially for beginners who might not understand the new format. Live chat support is a big positive too, although not every social casino has it.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are the advantages of sweepstakes casinos?</h2><p>The biggest advantage of sweepstakes casinos is how widely available they are. You can join and play at sweeps sites from every single state in the US (with the exception of Washington, Nevada, and Idaho) and from parts of Canada.&nbsp;</p><p>Compared with traditional casino platforms, which are still only legal in a handful of states, it‚Äôs a massive plus point for sweeps platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>Social casinos and sweeps casinos also offer a special gameplay experience. The clue is in the name, but there is much more of an emphasis on sociability, sharing your highs and lows with the community on social media, and taking part in giveaways and promotions, and generally having fun.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are the disadvantages of sweepstakes casinos?</h2><p>If you are used to playing at regular casinos, social casinos can sometimes feel a little underdeveloped. The whole industry is younger, the software of different platforms might be less slick and on the whole there are fewer games available.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, if you‚Äôre solely interested in winning cash prizes, the process is not straightforward. You will need to purchase Gold Coins and you may often recieve Sweeps Coins. Only when you play with Sweeps Coins, you can redeem your winnings for cash prizes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/fortune-coins-affiliates-logo.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Are sweepstakes and social casinos legal in the US?</h2><p>Yes, they are. Sweeps and social casinos are legally distinct from regular casinos and don‚Äôt require a gambling license to operate and provide entertainment. However, they are still regulated and their model operates under sweepstakes laws.&nbsp;</p><p>Sweepstakes coins can only ever be received for free, never purchased. All of this is part of the format that designates the games as types of sweepstakes contests, not gambling.&nbsp;</p><p>The regulation is subject to a certain amount of change, so it‚Äôs always worth checking availability before you sign up for a sweepstakes casino, but sweepsites are generally available for everyone over the age of 18 in the following states:</p><ul><li>Alabama</li><li>Alaska</li><li>Arizona</li><li>Arkansas</li><li>California</li><li>Colorado</li><li>Connecticut</li><li>Delaware</li><li>Florida</li><li>Georgia</li><li>Hawaii</li><li>Illinois</li><li>Indiana</li><li>Iowa</li><li>Kansas</li><li>Kentucky</li><li>Louisiana</li><li>Maine</li><li>Maryland</li><li>Massachusetts</li><li>Michigan</li><li>Minnesota</li><li>Mississippi</li><li>Missouri</li><li>Montana</li><li>Nebraska</li><li>Nevada</li><li>New Hampshire</li><li>New Jersey</li><li>New Mexico</li><li>New York</li><li>North Carolina</li><li>North Dakota</li><li>Ohio</li><li>Oklahoma</li><li>Oregon</li><li>Pennsylvania</li><li>Rhode Island</li><li>South Carolina</li><li>South Dakota</li><li>Tennessee</li><li>Texas</li><li>Utah</li><li>Vermont</li><li>Virginia</li><li>West Virginia</li><li>Wisconsin</li><li>Wyoming</li></ul><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">High 5 welcome bonus</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/thesun-high5-casino-offers.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Get 250 GC, 5 SC and 600 diamonds!</p><p>18+ Sweeps Play is only available in the United States, excluding Washington, Nevada, Michigan, and Idaho.

As we‚Äôve covered, sweepstakes casinos are both legal and regulated by local authorities. Sweepstakes casino sites are required to verify the identity of their players, and you‚Äôll probably have to submit some personal documentation (like a driver‚Äôs license) before you can redeem prizes.</p><p>Of course, every site is different and it‚Äôs difficult to be totally definitive about every single one. But the top sweeps sites in the US - like the ones that made it onto our list above - have been safely and legally offering their services for years now, and built up solid reputations in the industry.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Are sweepstakes casinos new?</strong></h2><p>Not exactly. VGW for instance - the company behind sweeps sites including Chumba Casino, Luckyland and Global Poker - launched back in 2010. Chumba Casino itself, considered one of the originators of social gaming and sweeps gaming in the US, was founded in 2012, with Global Poker following in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it‚Äôs really in the last five years or so that social casinos and sweepstakes casinos developed a foothold in the US, and the number of players and sites began to expand exponentially.&nbsp;</p><p>The industry has modernized and expanded a lot in that time, in everything from software design and mobile gaming, to the variety of games available and payment methods supported.&nbsp;</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Luckyland Slots welcome bonus</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/luckyland-slots-logo.png><p class=article__content--intro>7777 gold coins + 10 sweeps coins free</p><p>18+ Available in all US states except WA, NV, and ID.

That said, there are some similarities too.&nbsp;</p><p>First legally: the games at sweeps casinos are not gambling. Instead, they are sweepstakes contests, just like the promotional tools used by countless companies in the US.&nbsp;</p><p>All the games are available for free and there is no obligation to spend a dime if you prefer not to. In fact, you can‚Äôt withdraw and deposit money even if you want to.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though you can potentially redeem cash prizes, cash prizes is just one aspect of the whole experience of sweeps casinos. Playing for fun and for free, getting involved on social media, and sharing your wins with the community - these are all big parts of the social and sweeps experience, in a way that isn‚Äôt really the case at regular casinos.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, although the format and atmosphere are different, the actual games available at sweepstakes casinos can feel very similar to regular casino games. Slots are the most popular, but you can also find sweeps versions of blackjack, roulette, bingo, and many more.&nbsp;</p><p>If regular casinos aren‚Äôt available in your state, sweeps sites are a good alternative.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Can you win real money at sweepstakes casinos?</h2><p>No, sweepstakes casinos do not offer real money gambling. Sweepstakes casinos are online platforms that uses virtual coins to play casino games.</p><p>Winnings are awarded in the form of more coins such as Gold Coins, which can then be used to redeem cash prizes or to enter sweepstakes contests to win real-world prizes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to sign up and play at a USA sweepstakes casino</h2><p>Signing up to a sweepstakes casino is very simple.&nbsp;</p><p>It really just requires providing some basic personal information and account details, like the below:</p><ul><li><strong>Full name</strong></li><li><strong>Date of birth</strong></li><li><strong>Email address</strong></li><li><strong>Username</strong></li><li><strong>Password</strong></li><li><strong>Address</strong></li><li><strong>Phone number</strong></li><li><strong>SSN</strong></li></ul><p>Remember that you‚Äôll also need to verify your identity, either when you first sign up or before you can request a prize redemption with supported payment methods like PayPal, Skrill, Mastercard, Visa, or American Express, for instance.&nbsp;</p><p>This process is relatively simple too, although it takes a little bit of time. You‚Äôll need to send some personal documentation to the customer support team at the casino, which matches the details you provided for your account. Normally, a driver‚Äôs license or bank statement does the job.&nbsp;</p><p>Your details get reviewed and once everything is confirmed as good to go, all the features of your account get fully unlocked. Until you are verified, you‚Äôll find some restrictions.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Stake.us welcome bonus</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/ezgif-5-e3ec1cf42b.webp?crop=0px%2C67px%2C400px%2C266px&resize=620%2C413"><p class=article__content--intro>25 Stake Cash + 250,000 Gold Coins</p><p>21+ Available in all US states except WA, NV, and ID.

However, it‚Äôs certainly improving and only going to continue to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>It‚Äôs also worth remembering that sweeps sites have limitations on the technologies they can use to send out cash prizes redeemed through Sweeps Coins.</p><p>We‚Äôre covering the main methods to be aware of in this section:</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Visa / Mastercard</h3><p>Bank cards are by far the most common method used to purchase Gold Coins. These transactions are simple, fast and come with low payment limits - making them ideal for even GC purchases of a couple of dollars. Paying via bank card also works well on mobile apps, especially when you have a card saved on your phone.&nbsp;</p><p>The main downside is that bank cards normally can‚Äôt be used to redeem cash prizes. Instead, you can usually either nominate a bank account that must be in the same name as your card to receive a transfer, or instead get a gift card sent to the email associated with your account.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Bank Transfers</h3><p>Bank transfers make a lot of sense, because you can normally use them both to purchase Gold Coins and receive your cash prize redemptions. They usually carry no additional fees and purchases are processed instantly. It can take a few business days for the transfer to reach your account however, when you redeem your cash prizes.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>PayPal / Skrill</h3><p>PayPal and Skrill are e-wallets which are both extremely popular in the world of real money online gambling, and starting to become more widely available at sweeps sites too. They can typically be used both for coin purchases and receiving prize redemptions. They are also fast, cheap, secure and very mobile friendly.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How do coins work at social and sweepstakes casinos?</h2><p>Social and sweepstakes casinos use virtual tokens, normally called coins, to play their games.&nbsp;</p><p>The most common designations are gold coins and sweeps coins. These are the generic names that many social casinos employ, but some platforms have their own specific names. For example, at Funzpoints Casino the two are known as Standard Funzpoints and Premium Funzpoints respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Both gold coins and sweeps coins can be received for free, and neither has any real-world value. Although similar, they have some important differences at sweepstakes casinos.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are gold coins at a sweepstakes casino?</h2><p>Playing with gold coins - often called ‚ÄúStandard Mode‚Äù or something similar -&nbsp; is reminiscent of playing for play-money at a regular casino. You‚Äôll receive gold coins for free when you sign up, and normally also get a top-up every day you sign into your account.&nbsp;</p><p>You also have the option of purchasing additional gold coins, normally in the form of packages or bundles of different sizes.</p><p>Gold coins have no real-world value and cannot be redeemed for prizes. Their only function is playing games at the Sweeps Casino.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are cash coins in the US sweepstakes?</h2><p>Cash coins or sweepstakes coins are the second type of token used at sweeps sites. Playing with them is often referred to as ‚ÄúSweepstakes Mode‚Äù.</p><p>Just like gold coins, sweepstakes coins are available for free in a number of different ways. You‚Äôll get some for free when you sign up, as part of your daily login bonus, &nbsp;via social media giveaways, even via mail requests, and win as you play. More on that later.</p><p>You‚Äôll also normally receive some for free when you purchase gold coins. Still, sweepstakes coins cannot be purchased themselves, only received for free.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike gold coins, sweeps coins can be redeemed for prizes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Gold coins vs sweeps coins: What‚Äôs the difference?</strong></h2><p>Gold Coins and Sweeps Coins are the two virtual currencies used at sweepstakes casinos. They share some similarities: both can be obtained totally free and have no real world monetary value, and are used exclusively to play the games on the sweeps site. But they have some important differences too.</p><p>Gold Coins are used in Standard Mode, and are more commonly associated with social casino games as opposed to sweepstakes games. You‚Äôll get a supply of Gold Coins for free when you sign up, and can also pick up free top ups in a variety of ways - daily login bonuses, social media giveaways and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Gold Coins are solely used for playing games. They can‚Äôt be redeemed for any type of prize and the only benefit to winning more is in building up your virtual supply. It‚Äôs like playing games in demo mode.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also purchase additional Gold Coins. When you do, you often receive some free Sweeps Coins as a bonus.</p><p>Sweeps Coins are used to play games in Sweepstakes Mode. When we talk about ‚Äúsweepstakes casinos‚Äù (as opposed to ‚Äúsocial casinos‚Äù) we normally refer to playing with Sweeps Coins.</p><p>Unlike Gold Coins, Sweeps Coins can never be purchased, only ever received for free via a bonus. You can get free SCs in various ways -&nbsp; when you purchase Gold Coin packages, via daily login bonuses, and even by sending a written request to your sweepstakes casino.&nbsp;</p><p>Also unlike Gold Coins, your winning Sweeps Coins can be redeemed for prizes, including gift cards and cash prizes. It depends on the site, but one Sweeps Coin is often redeemable at a value of $1. You‚Äôll need a minimum number of SCs to request a redemption (often 50 or 100), and you can only redeem SCs you have won, not received for free.&nbsp;</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Global Poker welcome bonus</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/download-2.png><p class=article__content--intro>Get 150,000 GC for $10 +30 FREE SC</p><p>18+ Available in all US states except WA, NV, and ID.

In fact, many platforms offer slot machines more or less exclusively. The range of slots on offer is typically impressive, with good variation in terms of the themes, types of spins, the number of reels, the types of bonus games and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Megaways games, progressive jackpots and other features that have long been popular at regular casinos have made their way to sweeps casinos too. In fact, we‚Äôre increasingly seeing games from the same software providers at sweeps sites and regular casinos, such as Pragmatic Play, NetEnt, Betsoft, Evoplay, and Novomati.</p><p>Lots of sweeps sites have slot contests and leaderboards too, which offer additional sweeps coins in prizes.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Table games</h3><p>Table games are considerably less widely available than slots, but they are still pretty popular. Blackjack and roulette are fairly common sweepstakes games, and you can also find types of social poker, scratchcards, craps, bingo games, keno, Wheel of Fortune-type games and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike at regular casinos, you can probably expect to find one version of each table game at most.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What are the most popular sweepstakes slots?</strong></h2><p>It varies a lot site by site, especially since many sweepstakes casinos create their own in-house games - in contrast to the top real money gambling sites which have games from a selection of reputable software providers.</p><p>Below, you can see some of our favorite games at sweepstakes casinos:</p><ul><li>Egyptian Dreams - Ancient Egypt is an absolute classic slot theme, and Egyptian Dreams is a perfect iteration of the brand: an atmospheric blend of ancient symbols set in a sandy wasteland.&nbsp;</li><li>Buffalo Hold and Win - this game designed by Booming Games utilizes the popular Hold and Win format, where special symbols become sticky in the bonus game for extra wins.&nbsp;</li><li>Great Rhino: Megaways - designed by Pragmatic Play, this is a great opportunity to play the classic Megaways format in a social casino, featuring up to 200,704 ways to win on every single spin.</li><li>Caishen Wealth - this is a Chinese Luck themed slot, featuring a 5x4 grid, sticky wilds and three separate in-game jackpots: the Mini, the Minor and the Major worth 150x.&nbsp;</li><li>Fruit Party 2 - this game from Pragmatic Play is inspired by games like Candy Crush, where all touching fruit symbols of five or more count as a winning line, and disappear to be replaced by new fruits.</li><li>Dog House - this cartoony slot feels like something designed by Pixar, and features sticky wilds and multipliers, with a max win of 6,750x.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What is the best sweepstakes slot feature you can't miss out on?</strong></h2><p>Talk about how there isn't really one thing, rather there are a lot of stuff, such as symbols, jackpots, scatter, etc.</p><p>That‚Äôs a tricky question to answer. Sweepstakes slots have really been developing a lot in the last couple of years, and the variety of options at the top sweeps sites is now approaching traditional real casinos. In some cases, you can even play sweepstakes versions of the exact same games.&nbsp;</p><p>All that goes to say that there is not really just one feature you can‚Äôt miss out on, rather a whole host of exciting facets of sweepstakes slots.</p><p>You can stick to classic three-reel Vegas style games if you want, but you can also find more modern multi-reel slots with expanding symbols and expandable grids. Features like cascading reels, expanding wilds and free spin bonus rounds are all in play. You can also play Megaways sweepstakes games.</p><p>Modern sweeps sites even have progressive jackpot slots for both Gold Coins and Sweeps Coins.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What sweepstakes site has the best slots?</strong></h2><p>It‚Äôs tough to single out just one site, since they all have their strengths and weaknesses, as well as their own unique appeals in terms of design and user experience. That said, we‚Äôre going to have to give the nod here to High 5 casino.</p><p>High 5 Casino just really doesn‚Äôt have any weaknesses in terms of slots with multiple hundreds in the selection. In fact, there are well over 600 different slot games on the menu, which is extremely impressive for a sweepstakes site.</p><p>There is a separate section for slots with progressive jackpots, of which there are more than a dozen games. There are around 300 games from Pragmatic Play, one of the top software providers in the world whose games are all over real money casinos.&nbsp;</p><p>Throw in a selection of live dealer games - a real rarity at sweepstakes casinos - and you can see why we‚Äôve gone for High 5 Casino.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Are sweepstakes casino slots safe to use?</strong></h2><p>Yes, provided you choose reputable and regulated sites that are adhering to the sweepstakes rules in each US state - like the ones we‚Äôve recommended on this page.&nbsp;</p><p>From a personal health perspective, it‚Äôs essential to practice responsible playing habits at sweeps sites. Even though sweepstakes casinos offer free play, with no purchase required to join up and play the games - it‚Äôs important to recognize that there are risks associated with playing at sweeps sites.&nbsp;</p><p>They are not a way to make money, and should be regarded as a fun pastime only. Sweepstakes sites are also ultimately businesses which exist to make a profit from their players, and this shouldn't be overlooked.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the best sweepstakes casino in the US?</h2><p>Chumba Casino is one of the originators of the format in the US, and the platform is still deservedly among the most popular out there.
