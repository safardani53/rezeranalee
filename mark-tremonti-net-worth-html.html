He was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">named</a> Guitarist of the Year&nbsp;for three consecutive years by Guitar World, while in 2011, Total Guitar magazine listed him as the fourth greatest heavy metal guitarist of all time. In 2019, Tremonti was named one of The Guitarists of the Decade&nbsp;by readers of the Guitar World magazine who also named other guitarists like&nbsp;Tosin Abasi,&nbsp;Joe Bonamassa,&nbsp;Gary Clark Jr.,&nbsp;Eric Gales,&nbsp;Synyster Gates, and many more. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Apart from being a guitarist, he was also an equally talented songwriter and placed songwriting above all other crafts. His songwriting efforts have won him Grammys in his decades-long career as a musician.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Tremonti’s Illustrious Career</h2><p>Tremonti started his musical journey in 1993 when singer Scott Stapp, bassist Brian Marshall, drummer Scott Phillips, and Tremonti formed Creed. They&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">released</a>&nbsp;their debut album,&nbsp;<span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>My Own Prison, in 1997, which became an immense success.&nbsp;</p><p>The band sold seven million copies of the album in the U.S. alone and it was certified sextuple&nbsp;platinum. Creed's second album titled&nbsp;Human Clay&nbsp;was a much greater hit and&nbsp;sold 12 million units and won a Grammy Award for the song,&nbsp;‘With Arms Wide Open.’</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>A third album,&nbsp;Weathered, was released before they split in 2004, and by then, they had&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sold</a>&nbsp;over 28 million records. After the split, Tremonti, Marshall, and Phillips reemerged as Alter Bridge with lead singer Myles Kennedy. The new group released six albums and enjoyed significant success, but it was nothing to&nbsp;the scale of Creed.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Currently, Tremonti is working on his solo project, which is slated for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">release</a>&nbsp;in 2021.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Tremonti’s Personal Life and Networth</h2><p>Tremonti’s success of Creed and his critically acclaimed work in Alter Bridge has allowed him to amass a hefty net worth, much of which comes from his record and tour sales. Later, the musician branched out into other areas of the music industry to inflate it even more.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2008,&nbsp;Tremonti’s brother, Dan, launched&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Fret12 </a>which started out as a guitar instructional tool.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Fret12 has grown into a business where fans can ask questions and listen to the sounds and stories of professional guitarists to enhance their guitar skills. They can also buy guitar supplies, apparel, and signed instruments from their favorite luminaries.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Tremonti also&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">collaborated</a>&nbsp;with PRS guitars to release his own guitars known as the Mark Tremonti Signature Model.</p><p>According to Celebrity Networth, Tremonti is&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">worth</a> $16 million. The outlet also reported that he lives in a custom-built mansion worth almost $8 million with his wife, Victoria Rodriguez, and sons, Austen and Pearson. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGikrquZmHyurdGkZK2qlaK8r8DIZqWerF2svLPAx2efraWc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
