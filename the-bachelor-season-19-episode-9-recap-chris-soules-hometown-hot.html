Or would the one-time frontrunner be sent to the front of the line … at the airport?</p><p>The latter. After Sunday’s meltdown, Britt apparently realized she wasn’t the only pretty girl in competition for Chris Soules’ heart. On THE BACHELOR.</p><p>As such, she decided to bail rather than risk being rejected … then when he nixed the cocktail party, raced to give Chris one last chance to beg her to stay.</p><p>He didn’t. On the contrary, he all but sent her packing.</p><p>Soules politely but firmly took her to task for creating this "really tough position," and wasn’t having any of her attempts to throw Carly under the bus, either.</p><p>"The way you reacted and disrespected myself and everyone around you was something that I don’t want for a wife," Chris said, and walked her out.</p><p>Carly clearly relished in <a href=#>Britt Nilsson</a>‘s squirming, cringing, departure … for about two minutes, until she was cut at the rose ceremony. Karma. It will get you.</p><p>Keep squirming, Carly. She got cut during the rose ceremony. (And that, ladies, is the karmic punishment you receive for treating other women awfully.)</p><p>That meant Jade, Kaitlyn, Whitney and Becca received the coveted hometown dates, and we’ll begin with the latter, who took him home to Louisiana.</p><p>Long story short, her family’s reaction to her bringing home a man, let alone a camera crew, was so awkward Chris may never want to return there.</p><p>She still hadn’t told him that she’s a virgin, even though there were many hints dropped and it’s really not that big of a deal. But she loves ferris wheels.</p><p>Like, loves ferris wheels. When you’ve never had sex …</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>The Bachelor: Season 19 Conestant Photos</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>Anyway, Becca Tilley has company in Whitney Bischoff, whose family seemed equally surprised and thrown off by the fact that Chris was with her.</p><p>Did these girls’ families not know where they were?</p><p>Chris wanted Whitney’s sister’s approval, should he decide to propose, but Kimberly wasn’t having it unless she knew Whit was the only one for him.</p><p>Whitney dropped the L-bomb on him later on.</p><p>It was a little disappointing for us that Kaitlyn Bristowe took Chris to Phoenix, Arizona, and not her native Canada, but her family clear has the right idea.</p><p>Winter in Arizona vs. Alberta? We get it.</p><p>For some reason, Kaitlyn decided to bring Chris to a recording studio, where they recorded a rap song. Was this storyline left over from 4-5 weeks ago?</p><p>Kaitlyn’s parents gave Chris the standard, Bachelor parents treatment, welcoming them but expressing trepidation that their little girl will get heartbroken.</p><p>Now for the main event. <a href=#>Jade Roper</a>.</p><p>One of her brothers called her a "wild mustang," which puzzled Chris, who only knows the shy, soft-spoken version of Jade that she’s shown us this season.</p><p>Not Playboy Jade, in other words.</p><p>She finally came clean about her nude modeling past, even firing up her computer to show him the photos, which must have been incredibly odd for him.</p><p>Chris’ giggle made an appearance, and it’s hard to blame him in this case, as you don’t end up in a situation like this often – while being filmed no less.</p><p>Not surprisingly, he understood.</p><p>Soules admitted that he would "never have expected this to be a part of her past," but told her, in typical fashion, that "I judge you for the person you are."</p><p>"You are a beautiful woman, and it’s not something I feel would affect our relationship in any way. I know you for who you are as a person, and I respect you."</p><p>"I’m looking to fall in love with a person," he told the brunette beauty, "not their career or certain things they’ve done in their past they might not be proud of."</p><p>Unfortunately for Jade, it wasn’t enough to save her at the rose ceremony, as Whitney, Becca and Kaitlyn all got roses, with the Wild Mustang cut loose.</p><p>Did Chris make the right decision by eliminating Jade, Britt and Carly? And do you think Jade Roper’s Playboy spread really had nothing to do with it?</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Jade Roper Playboy Pictures</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2ptX2V%2FcMDHnmSbmZOdsq270WaqnpmjpLtufZhmnKmho6SxpnmYZqmem5GleqS00aKqZqufqrmmv4yhpqadpKTEr3nHqKto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
