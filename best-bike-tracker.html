If your bike does get stolen, the tracker might make it possible to find it again, and hopefully in one piece.</p><p>They are generally small GPS tracking devices that are hidden on the bike, and are integrated into a component such as a bike light or a handle bar’s end. Some though act as an additional deterrent, highlighting to would-be thieves that the bike they’re attempting to steal has a tracker fitted.</p><p>Although a relatively new technology, there are already a host of bike trackers available on the market, and each has a range of different features.</p><p>Not sure where to start? Read our guide below to find out about the best bike trackers you can buy.</p><h2><strong>Shield GPS Portable Tracker</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/81Mzf3xyUhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg><ul><li><strong>Shield GPS tracker, £29.99 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>With realtime GPS tracking, and location updates every ten seconds, this miniature tracker is an excellent way to keep your bicycle safe.</p><p>One of the smallest trackers on the market, it will handily attach to your bike frame without drawing attention to itself.</p><p>It’s worth noting that a subscription is required for it to work though.

And if it is stolen, you'll receive a live location – accurate to within a couple of meters – that can be passed onto the police.</p><h2>Apple AirTag</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/airtag-double-select-202104.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Apple AirTag, £29.99 from Apple - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Apple’s take on the miniature, attach-to-anything tracker, the AirTag is designed to be as small a lightweight as possible.</p><p>Intended to be used on anything, from keys to your backpack and of course, bicycles, the AirTag connects to Apple’s Find My app, making it incredibly easy to keep track of your valuables.</p><p>Simply stick one on to your bike and forget about it. You can even add a personalised engraving, perfect for giving as a present to a forgetful loved one.</p><h2>How do bike trackers work?</h2><p>The majority of bike trackers work by transmitting a GPS signal that can be tracked via an app or website if you're unfortunate enough to have your bike stolen. By being hidden discretely on your bike, any would-be thieves might not realise that the bike has a tracker fitted to it, allowing you to find your pride and joy before it is lost forever.</p><h2>How much is a bike tracker</h2><p>You don't need to spend that much on a bike tracker. Basic ones cost as little as £25 and feature GPS and real time tracking, which is essentially all you need.</p><p>Bike trackers can cost upwards of £100 however. For this price range you can expect to find trackers integrated into lights, or built into handlebars, which are usually more discreet than regular trackers.</p><p>Bike thieves are becoming increasingly aware of trackers, and may look to remove them before stealing a bike. An integrated tracker is usually impossible to spot, so they're worthy of consideration if you can stretch your budget.</p><h2>How to install a bike tracker</h2><p>Bike trackers are incredibly easy to install. Most small trackers come with strong, in-built magnets, which allows them to simply attach to your bike's metal frame.</p><p>Some come with sticky adhesive pads, and other larger ones may need to be manually attached with cable ties. We'd recommend sticking with magnetised trackers however, for their discreetness and ease of use.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE FROM SUN SELECTS HEALTH AND FITNESS</h2></p><p>Enjoyed our roundup of the best bike trackers?
