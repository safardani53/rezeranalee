No, canceled,” the 43-year-old said with a face of disgust.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The response from Kate comes eight years after her&nbsp;My Best Friend’s Girl&nbsp;costar dished about their on-screen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>lip-lock</a> to TV host, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a>. “I did a movie with her, My Best Friend’s Girl, and I think she purposely ate like a feast of onions before our scene,” he dished at the time. “I had to burn her on that one!” Janelle asked Kate to compare the other <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>men’s kisses</a>, including&nbsp;her previous costars <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Matthew McConaughey</strong></a>, 53, and&nbsp;Almost Famous&nbsp;star&nbsp;<strong>Billy Crudup</strong>, 54.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Matthew starred in&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</a> alongside Kate, who played his love interest, Andy Anderson. And Billy, on the other hand, played Russell in&nbsp;Almost Famous&nbsp;alongside the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mom-of-three</a> in 2000. “I think Billy is a gentler kisser,” she revealed. “Better? I wouldn’t say better. But definitely just gentler.” She went on to clarify what she meant. “It’s a more sophisticated version of a kiss. It’s like theater. It’s like Stanislavski. And, like, [McConaughey is] Longhorns. You know what I mean?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kate-hudson-dane-cook-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>The hilarious lie detector test also missed that Kate “stole” something precious from the set of her latest film, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery. When asked by the 37-year-old hitmaker if Kate had taken anything from the movie, she claimed that she did not, but later she dished that the polygraph machine missed the lie! “I stole from the&nbsp;Glass Onion&nbsp;set,” Kate admitted. “I stole my jewels, but listen… I stole them and then I got permission.” Janelle ended the interview by joking that the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Oscar-nominee</a> was also “canceled.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Kate’s hilarious interview with&nbsp;Vanity Fair&nbsp;comes just four days after she took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to share a series of sweet photos of her family for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Christmas</a>. “Merry Christmas all of you beautiful people out there! Sending you crazy joy from our nutty family to yours,” she captioned the Dec. 26 post. And later, she shared a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>funny clip</a> of her family’s Christmas stockings, which included hers that was notably the smallest. “Even my stockings the middle child…,” Kate captioned the video. The starlet has three kids including: <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ryder Robinson</strong></a>, 18, <strong>Rani Rose Hudson Fujikawa</strong>, 4, and <strong>Bingham Hawn Bellamy</strong>, 11. Kate was previously married to musician&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chris Robinson</strong></a> from 2000 until 2007 and is currently not married.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze5JpZqSZpJp6qcHDrKanZaKarqTA0mabmqaVYrCwu8pmrqiqo6l6rLXSrGSvoZSavHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
