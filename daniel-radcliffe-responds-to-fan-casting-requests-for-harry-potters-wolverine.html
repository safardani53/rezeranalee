For 17 years, he kept the fans amused. After James Mangold’s Logan, though, the actor hung up his claws for good. Fans are guessing about the character’s return five years later in Doctor Strange: In the Multiverse of Madness. But, this time, who will be sporting the adamantium claws?</p><p>Various actors have been suggested for the role of Weapon X by fans. Daniel Radcliffe, the hero of Harry Potter, is one such actor who has piqued the interest of fans. The internet is clamoring for The Boy Who Lived to play Marvel’s most ruthless assassin.</p><h2>Fans want a tiny actor to play Wolverine in the comics, and Daniel Radcliffe, who stands at 5.4 feet, meets the requirement.</h2><p>When Daniel Radcliffe’s Logan fan art went popular, Potterheads flocked to the internet in droves. Fans were ecstatic to learn that Radcliffe, who is of average height, will play a comic-accurate Logan who is diminutive in stature. In a press conference at the SXSW screening of his new film, The Lost City, Radcliffe voiced his thoughts.</p><p>“I’ve had so many people say to me, ‘Hey guy, heard the Wolverine news, that’s really awesome,’ and so on. No, I have no knowledge about that. I like how someone is plainly thinking, “Wolverine is genuinely short in the comic books; you should find a short person to do it!”</p><p>Many people have speculated that the X-Men, particularly Wolverine, would feature in the next Doctor Strange film. Radcliffe, on the other hand, does not appear to be playing a part. In the same interview, Daniel claimed that,</p><p>“However, I don’t see myself or them moving from Hugh Jackman to me.” Who knows, though. Marvel, prove me wrong.”</p><p>While Potter fans are ecstatic to see Radcliffe don the claws, the rest of the internet doesn’t see him as a short-but-stout Weapon X. Twitter users have suggested Tom Hardy, Taron Egerton, and Jon Bernthal as potential claw wearers.</p><p>Will Daniel Radcliffe make a good Wolverine? If not, who will portray the X-Men, a fan favorite? Will Weapon X make an appearance in the MCU?</p><p>These are some of the issues that will hopefully be answered in Doctor Strange: In the Multiverse of Madness, which is set to be released on May 6, 2022. Doctor Strange stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen, Benedict Wong, and Chiwetel Ejiofor, with Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda, Benedict Wong as Wong, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Baron Mordo.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Daniel Radcliffe</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Daniel Radcliffe age</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibmqaZmrluvsCdmqWhlpuybr7ErKeoppSoerW7jJ%2BYp2WTlsC1tc2gZKudoaqytMDSZp2oql2drrO%2B2GanqKykmr%2B0edaoo6%2Bdop67pns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
