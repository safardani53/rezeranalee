The four-bed house is located in Hackey's Fassett Square, the &#34;real&#34; location behind the fictional soap drama's main square.
The stunning end-terrace house is located in Fassett Square, a sought after residential area, with a private garden that is for residents only.
The house looks completely unmodernised from the front, as though it was directly from the BBC soap itself."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

end-terrace house is located in Fassett Square, a sought after residential area, with a private garden that is for residents only.</p><p>The house looks completely unmodernised from the front, as though it was directly from the BBC soap itself.</p><p>But as you enter the four-bedroom Victorian terrace, it is quite the opposite.</p><p>The house is arranged over three floors and is deceptively spacious boasting a size of 1,727sq ft.</p><p>On the ground level, there is a large open plan kitchen and dining area.</p><p>The blue kitchen countertops compliment the light wood furniture and white floor and ceiling.</p><p>From the kitchen, a large sliding door takes you to a peaceful decked and paved garden.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

a bay window, high skirting boards and a wood-burning fireplace.</p><p>Heading upstairs to the first floor there are three double bedrooms with a modern family sized bathroom, with a master double bedroom and ensure bathroom on the top floor.</p><p>This property also has a highly desired off-street parking space, a rarity for the area.</p><p>Fassett Square is a highly desirable location, with both the open green spaces of London Fields and Broadway Market nearby.</p><p>Thirty-two years ago EastEnders' creator Julia Smith was originally going to film the soap on location but it was eventually decided to use Elstree studios instead.</p><p>Nevertheless, Albert Square still holds true to the square where it takes its inspiration.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in news</h2></p><p>The 56 homes in Fassett Square are identical, right down to the measurements, to those built on the Albert Square set location.</p><p>Similarities between the two garden squares are less noticed nowadays than they were when the series’ creators first discovered the Hackney square in 1985.</p><p>Rapid gentrification of Hackney in the 32 years since EastEnders was first broadcast on TV has changed both the residents and look of the area.</p><p>Brad Suter, head of Savills Hackney office said: “Located in a prime part of East London with popular London Fields and Broadway Market nearby, this is a stunning end-terrace house situated in famous Fassett Square, a private garden square with residents-only access.</p><p>"Beautifully designed, this would make the perfect house for any family to grow into.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
