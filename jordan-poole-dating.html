The Ice Spice dating rumors explained.</h2><p>On Sunday, March 12, a Twitter account by the name of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@ButtcrackSports</a> seemingly confirmed that Jordan and Ice Spice were dating.</p><p>“She was spotted with Poole at a Warriors game a few nights ago,” another tweet in the thread alleged. Alongside the tweet was a clip of Ice Spice sitting courtside rocking a shirt that said “Hottest team in the NBA”.</p><p>Shortly after, fans reacted to the news on social media. “Can Ice Spice and Jordan Poole start dating already? She'll be courtside for all Warriors games and JP would drop 30 every night,” one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> user joked.</p><p>However, Distractify can confirm that the rumored romance between Jordan and the “Munch” rapper is fake news.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The video in question was actually taken at the Knicks vs. Warriors game in December 2022.

The speculations came not long after Pete and Chase Sui Wonders took their situationship public at Daytona 500.</p><p>Before that, Ice Spice sparked dating rumors with Stranger Things star Caleb McLaughlin when they were spotted together at an event in New York. A source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Media Take Out</a> that they had only recently started dating but were “really into each other.”</p><p>Additionally, there were (unsubstantiated) rumors that linked Ice Spice to <a href=#>Drake</a> and <a href=#>Lil Tjay</a>.
