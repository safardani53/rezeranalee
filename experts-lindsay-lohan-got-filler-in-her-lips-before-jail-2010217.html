PHOTOS: Star mug shots!
&#34;There is no question that Ms. Lohan had filler of some type in her lips,&#34; Dr. Michael Olding, the Chief of the Division of Plastic Surgery at George Washington University (and director of the Cosmetic Surgery & Laser Center), tells Us."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Multiple plastic surgeons tell <a href=#>UsMagazine.com</a> that the actress, 24, surgically plumped her pout before checking into the Lynwood Regional Detention Center Tuesday to serve just 14 days of her 90-day sentence.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Star mug shots!</a></p><p>"There is no question that Ms. Lohan had filler of some type in her lips," <a href=#>Dr. Michael Olding</a>, the Chief of the Division of Plastic Surgery at George Washington University (and director of the Cosmetic Surgery & Laser Center), tells <strong>Us</strong>.</p><p>Says dermatologist Dr. Kenneth Beer, owner of <a href=#>ScientificSkin.com</a> (who, like the other surgeons quoted here, have not treated Lohan), "She has had injections of a filler such as Restylane or Juvederm. To me, it looks like about 1 to 2 syringes of product were used on her upper and lower lips… it will last for about 6 to 8 months." (He also suspects she "had some Botox [injected into] her forehead and frown lines.")</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Child stars gone bad</a></p><p>In the "before" photos — taken around the time Lohan's SCRAM bracelet went off at the MTV Movie Awards in June — "her lips look asymmetric, so she was probably having filler even then," points out Dr. Olding.</p><p>But he believes she got a touch up before checking into jail because, "There is often an initial period of swelling that occurs with injection that rapidly resolves within the first 24 hours."</p><p>Adds Dr. Beer: "Perhaps she overfilled them a little bit with the anticipation that her access to her dermatologist or plastic surgeon might be limited for the foreseeable future." (She was also sentenced to check into a 90-day rehab center upon her release from jail.)</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Stars' plastic surgery nightmares</a></p><p>Lohan also won't have access to plastic surgeons in prison in case there are medical issues, but that shouldn't be a problem. "Given the fact that she has probably had it previously, and therefore will not be 'allergic,' she will likely not have any complications," says Dr. Olding.</p><p>Could she have enhanced her lips to look sexier in this mug shot than <a href=#>the one from 2007</a>?</p><p>"Lohan knew the photo of her mugshot would be widely distributed. It is likely she had it done for this reason," dermatologist <a href=#>Dr. Marcy Street</a> tells <strong>Us</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lohan could have even asked for a specific look.</p><p>"On the upper lip, a common technique is to inject the filler along the border between the pink of the lip and the normal skin — this gives a 'pouty' look to the lip," says New York City plastic surgeon Dr. <a href=#>Elliot W. Jacobs</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5rFsbHRrapmpJmjsbSt2GajqKCRo3qou9NmnaKknJq%2FbrXNZp%2Beql2htrG%2FjJucn6eimnqrrcilZGtoYWV%2FcoOO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
