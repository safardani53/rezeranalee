In the past few years, the value has increased by eighty percent.</p><p>Similarly, contract payments, brand endorsements, and personal assets add to the net worth.</p><p>Likewise, Jon makes around $500,000 every bout, and if he wins Performance of the Night or Fight of the Night, he gets an additional $50,000.</p><p>However, in the very beginning days of his career, in 2008, Jon earned $12,000. Moreover, without a doubt, Jon Jones has made more than $3 million in his career.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Brock Lesnar Bio: WWE, Net Worth, UFC, NFL & Wife >></strong></a></p><h3>Salary & Income</h3><p>Apart from UFC and MMA, this young man’s other significant source of income is a slew of brand endorsements and endorsement deals.</p><p>In his recent bout in UFC, Jones earned $500,000 against Matt Hamill. Likewise, his total career earnings in the UFC are $7,230,000.</p><p>Also, in the UFC, Jon Jones comes in #4 in the Top 10 Highest Paid UFC Fighters list. As we all know, the former fighter has only lost one match as a mixed martial artist.</p><p>But Jon was given $20,000 for that fight, and he lost that match against Matt Hamill in the finale of Ultimate Fighter 10.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/jon-jones-1.jpg><p>Likewise, Jon’s per-fight salary was significantly less at that time. In 2009 at the UFC94 match, he earned $14,000 that night. Out of which, $7,000 was a win bonus.&nbsp;</p><p>However, in 2010, everything started to change for Jon Jones.</p><p>First, Jon wins a match against Vera; thus, he gets $90,000 for that bout. Indeed, this was his highest career earnings at that time.</p><h3>Prize & Reward Money</h3><p>Jon got $20,000 as a win bonus and $50,000 as a Knockout of the Night Bonus. After setting record after record in his every fight, Jon finally got recognition.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, audiences started to appreciate him, and UFC gave him suitable title matches.&nbsp;</p><p>Jones has also appeared in a documentary/ fantasy, Fight Church. Not to mention, the movie is based on the confluence of Christianity and mixed martial arts, including ministries that train fighters.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, Jon has also appeared in the 2016 documentary, The Hurt Business, based on various fighters like <a href=# rel=noopener>Georges St-Pierre</a> and Ronda Rousey, which showcases the rise of mixed martial arts and these stars.</p><p>At the same time, the former champ has earned a lot of money from various brand deals and endorsements.</p><p>It is estimated that Jon makes $1-$2 million every year from these companies.</p><p>Therefore, all these endorsements and brand deals add a lot to Jon Jones’ net worth.</p><h3>Jon Jones Net Worth | Endorsements</h3><p>Jones has partnerships with several firms and businesses, including Nike, Reebok, Muscle Tech, K-Swiss, and many other prestigious brands.</p><p>Not to mention, Joe Jones is also the first client of Nike from UFC.</p><p>Besides, before Jon, no other UFC fighters were sponsored by Nike.</p><p>Undoubtedly, it was a million dollars contract, but neither Jon nor Nike disclosed any details about the agreement.</p><p>Similarly, Reebok signed Jon in 2014 with a promise of giving Jon a whopping amount of $2 million yearly.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, after three years, Nike and Reebok canceled the contract with Jones due to controversies.</p><p>However, Jon earned $6 million from these big deals for three years, and after their deal cancelation, Jon earned only $100,000 from various other minor endorsements.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, Jon spends 39.6% of his total money on various forms of taxes.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why did big brands like Nike and Reebok cancel their contract?&nbsp;</h3><p>If you are unaware, Jon’s felony conviction resulted in these big brands backing off. As we know, PPV sales are significant because wrestlers earn a certain amount of money from it.</p><p>However, if you hold a criminal record, there is no chance that the public will appreciate you and buy your merchandise and other kinds of stuff.</p><p>Not only is this a loss for any wrestler, but also for the brands sponsoring him.&nbsp;</p><p>So, Reebok and Nike cancel the contract with Joe Jones to maintain the brand’s reputation and prestige.</p><p>Undoubtedly, this is a massive loss for Jones because he lost his contract worth $10 million, yes! Ten million, this indeed is a huge loss.</p><h3>Will Jon Jones ever get these multi-millionaire brand deals again?</h3><p>After this absolute conviction, UFC suspended Jon. However, the suspension has been removed now, but Reebok still hasn’t returned to the table.</p><p>Nonetheless, he is getting other brand deals from GAT Nutrition, Muscle Tech, K-Swiss, etc., but these all brands are nowhere compared to the lubricative Reebok contract.</p><p>Similarly, they won’t do anything that would harm their brand value and face value. So, it is very doubtful that Jon will ever get big brand deals from renowned companies.</p><h2>Jon Jones Net Worth: Houses and Cars</h2><h3>House</h3><p>Jones owns a House in Itachi, New York, which he bought in 2012 for $644,500. This luxurious yet simple House is spread over an acre of land with four bedrooms and four bathrooms.</p><p>Apart from that, this House has some antique Viking appliances along with coffered and vaulted ceilings.</p><p>Likewise, this House has a three-car garage and a beautiful backyard, which is pleasing to the eyes.</p><p>However, Jon has listed the House for sale for $750,000.</p><p>But there is not much information about Jones moving to another place, but we will update the article soon to find any information regarding his new House.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Top Ten Best UFC Fights of All Time >></strong></a></p><h3>Jon Jones Net Worth: Cars</h3><p>Undoubtedly, Jones loves cars and even has a small car collection.

Likewise, Jones has three beautiful daughters with his girlfriend, <a href=#>Jessie Mosses</a>.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Jon travels in various places in the world from time to time but likes to spend time with his family whenever he is free.</p><p>Besides, Jon is a family man; if he is not working or training, he spends time with his family.</p><p>Similarly, Jon also takes his family on short trips now and then. Also, his family vacations near the sea, oceans, and beaches.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jon Jones Charity</h2><p>Jones has donated a lot of money to charity. However, he doesn’t have a charitable organization, but he helped people in need through various other organizations.</p><p>He uses his social media sites as a celebrity to raise awareness and funds.</p><p>Talking about his charitable works, Jon, in 2020, donated food for 100,000 families in New Mexico in collaboration with Food Debto.</p><p>Similarly, in 2019, Jon donated warm winter clothes to homeless people during the holiday season.</p><p>Likewise, in 2018, he vowed to give $100k in charity if another fighter could break his lightweight championship streak.</p><p>Similarly, Jon is also part of the “Giving Back to the Community” project. Then he donated $25,000 to the shoppers in Albuquerque during the holiday season.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jon Jones | Career</h2><p>Jon was interested in wrestling from a very early age; even before his MMA debut, he was a school wrestler and a state-level champion.</p><p>However, after being trained in various wrestling forms, Joe joined MMA in 2008. He was in MMA for a short period but didn’t lose any matches.</p><p>Nonetheless, he has fought in six MMA matches and won them all.

Since then, Joe hasn’t looked back and has made record after record.</p><p>The journey to the top was challenging; however, Jon overcame all those ups and downs.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Here you can watch the iconic fight between Jon Jones vs. Francis Ngannou >></a></strong></p><p>Wherever Jon is standing today, he deserves to be in that place because he has worked very hard, pulled himself over the limits, and proved himself every time.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Joe is an inspiration to many youths and aspiring fighters.</p><h2>Some Facts about Jon Jones</h2><ul><li>Jon has the most extended reach in UFC, which is six ft. 4 inches, which has helped him a lot to defeat his opponents.</li><li>Similarly, Jon is the youngest UFC Champion in the history of UFC.
