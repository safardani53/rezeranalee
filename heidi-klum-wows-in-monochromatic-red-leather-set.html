Klum donned a red monochromatic set equipped with a fitted leather jacket with rolled up sleeves, giving the look a slouchy feel. She paired the jacket with matching pants and knee-high stiletto boots.
The former Victoria’s Secret angel’s nail choice even matched the cherry-colored outfit."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In October 2022, Klum attended the annual New York City All Hallows Eve bash <a href=#>dressed as a worm</a> while husband <a href=#><strong>Tom Kaulitz</strong></a> came as a bloodied fisherman. (The pair have been linked since March 2018 and secretly wed in August 2019.)</p><p>Klum <a href=#>teased her upcoming Halloween look</a> on October 5, unveiling a scary movie poster inspired by her face that reads “Heidi Klum Halloween Coming Soon.”</p><p>“👻🕷️🧛🏻‍♀️🎃🦇🧟‍♂️💀🕸️🖤 #heidihalloween2023 #comingsoon Artwork by @mad.charcoal,” she captioned the Instagram video, featuring artist <strong>Josh Hernandez</strong> drawing an image in orange chalk.</p><p>While she has yet to unveil what the look will be this year, Klum did say that it would be “really extra.”</p><p>“I have had sleepless nights over it, you know me,” she told Daily Mail in September. “I have to admit, I love it. And then my gut, I feel like it’s going to be good.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Klum had previously said that her hope is for her guests to follow her lead for the holiday and even “implemented a ‘no costume-no entry’ rule” for her annual gathering in 2000.</p><p>“By me doing crazy, elaborate outfits as the host, my hope had always been that all my guests would follow. And it’s worked because over the years people have become increasingly more outrageous with their costumes,” she told The Hollywood Reporter in 2018. “The party has become almost legendary. It’s epic. I feel like my love for Halloween has made other people fall in love with the holiday too.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX52yqrDIZqKlrZ1ixLDD0magp2WdpLuwr8erpqaZpJ6wbr7EnWSlnZGptaa%2BjKycrWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
