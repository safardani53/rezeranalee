Morton</a>, Diana looked back on her days there as "the happiest time of her life".</p><p>“It was juvenile, innocent, uncomplicated and above all fun.</p><p>“'I laughed my head off there’ she said.”</p><p>The future princess even had a cheeky sign above her bedroom door which said: "Chief Chick.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT0004406644102.jpg><p>The pad, 60 Coleherne Court, cost £50,000, when it was secured for Diana by her sister Sarah, who worked at estate agent Savills in July 1979.</p><p>Princess Diana was hugely excited to move into the pad, and was joined by school friend Carolyn Bartholomew.</p><p>The pair were initially joined by pals Sophie Kimball and Philippa Coaker, but during her courtship of Prince Charles, the pair lived with Anne Bolton and Virginia Pitman.</p><p>Princess Diana charged the girls just £18 a week to stay in the flat, and she is said to have organised strict cleaning rotas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

into a “warm but simple Habitat style that was popular at the time.”</p><p>According to Andrew, Carolyn said: “She always had the rubber gloves on as she clucked about the place.</p><p>“But it was her house and when it is your own you are incredibly proud of it.”</p><p>The girls are said to have rarely cooked in the apartment, so Diana certainly didn’t have to worry about piles of dirty plates piling up.</p><p>Despite the fact that Virginia and Diana had completed expensive Cordon Bleu courses, the housemates tended to live off Harvest Crunch cereal and chocolate.</p><img

roulade and a Russian borscht soup, which were often requested by friends.</p><p>Despite her luxury surroundings, life in the apartment was relatively normal for Diana.</p><p>She worked at a nursery in Pimlico and was said to be “truly in her element.”</p><p>Her job was at the Young England kindergarten, ran by Victoria Wilson and Kay Seth-Smith in the St Saviour’s church hall.</p><p>Princess Diana spent her afternoons teaching the kids how to paint, draw, dance and play games.</p><p>She is said to have got on so well with the children that she was asked to work the mornings too, and on Tuesdays and Thursdays she looked after a child called Patrick Robinson, who was the son of an oil executive, and a student she “adored.”</p><img

class=article__bc_video-caption>The bizarre reason Prince Charles always looked taller than Princess Diana in pictures – when they were the SAME height</span><p>Although Charles and Diana met when she was 16 in November 1977, when he was dating her older sister Lady Sarah, it wasn’t until 1980 at a polo game when they started seeing each other romantically.</p><p>Prince Charles proposed in February 1981 and they were engaged in July of that year.</p><p>When she tied the knot with Prince Charles, she became the first royal bride to ever have a paying job before marrying an heir.</p><p>Later, Kate Middleton would become the first royal bride to have a university degree.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

was officially announced.</p><p>She left the girls and her pad to move into Clarence House, where the Queen Mother lived.</p><p>Following her July wedding, Diana’s mum Frances Shand Kydd sold the flat to Japanese buyers for £100,000, which was double what she paid for it.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FABULOUS</h2></p><p><a href=# rel>Princess Diana and Prince
