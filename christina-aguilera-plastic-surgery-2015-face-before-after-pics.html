Plastic and cosmetic surgeon, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dr.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Mark Youssef</strong></a>, M.D. of <strong><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Younique Cosmetic Surgery</a></strong> tells <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> EXCLUSIVELY that the difference could be due to makeup. “Although many of the changes you see in these photos could be due to different styles of make up, there could also be a few other explanations,” Dr. Youssef explained.&nbsp;“Christina definitely looks a few pounds heavier in the more recent picture which could explain the additional fullness in the cheeks and jawline.” Make up and weight gain&nbsp;aren’t the only things&nbsp;that can make&nbsp;someone’s face look&nbsp;different.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>“Another explanation for the changes in facial shape and contour could be dermal fillers,” Dr. Youssef continued. “They are a clear gel filler that is injected deep beneath the skin. They lift and volumize the cheek and jawline area to give a more youthful look.&nbsp;Celebrities just have to be careful to not ‘over do it’ because these fillers can start to look un-natural in large amounts.”&nbsp;It definitely could be either or. But, this isn’t the first time Christina has had work done on her body. The star reportedly&nbsp;had a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>nose job</a>, some collagen injected into her lips, and liposuction after the birth of her son <strong>Max</strong>.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a> also claims the singer had breast implants put in after seeing a scar on her armpit.</p><h3>Another Plastic & Cosmetic Surgeon&nbsp;Weighs In On Christina’s Facial Features</h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>Philadelphia Area Board Certified Plastic Surgeon, Dr.&nbsp;<strong>Lyle M. Back</strong>, MD FACS, thinks Christina definitely had some work done. Although Dr. Back didn’t treat the 34-year-old, he believes&nbsp;Christina had work done on her cheeks, chin, and nose. “She’s had another re-do rhinoplasty, but this was done very well. Cartilage grafts were used to rebuild, support and fill out her nose quite artistically. Her previous nasal surgery was way overdone and her nose was nearly whittled away,” the plastic and cosmetic surgery expert&nbsp;EXCLUSIVELY tells <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong>. “These are beautiful, significant improvements. But then she went too far with the filling of the cheeks. Her cheek implants are creating an overly full, almost fat appearing face and creating dents below them when she smiles because they are so huge. It also looks like she had a chin implant put in.” Dr. Back did not mince his words when he gave his opinion on Christina.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>What do you think,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?
