After changing his position from power forward to center, he led his team averaging 14.2 points and 2.4 blocks per game.</p><p>The former Gators center’s form kept improving, and by the end of the NCAA Division I men’s basketball tournament, he declared for the 2006 NBA draft.</p><p>However, Noah stayed with his team for the junior season, which resulted in a good season as the Florida Gators won the national championship in 2006-07.</p><p>Noah led his Gators over top-seeded Villanova in the final game and earned the Most Outstanding Player (MOP) of the NCAA Tournament’s Minneapolis Regional.
